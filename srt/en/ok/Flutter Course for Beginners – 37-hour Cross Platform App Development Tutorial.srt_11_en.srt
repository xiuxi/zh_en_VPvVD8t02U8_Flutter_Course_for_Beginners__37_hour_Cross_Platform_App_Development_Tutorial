1
11:58:25,272 --> 11:58:29,360
say context block auto import

2
11:58:29,360 --> 11:58:33,512
and we're going to call it password reset it's one of the keys i define and

3
11:58:33,512 --> 11:58:38,160
in here we're going to say context lock password reset dialog prompt okay

4
11:58:38,160 --> 11:58:42,552
and we have an ok button so you now by this point that we have an ok key as

5
11:58:42,552 --> 11:58:46,800
well in our in our arb file

6
11:58:46,800 --> 11:58:51,272
so now we've done basically we're done uh localizing the show password recent

7
11:58:51,272 --> 11:58:57,120
dialogue uh uh show password reset sends dialogue

8
11:58:57,120 --> 11:59:03,592
okay the next uh dialog is um forgot password so let's go to

9
11:59:03,592 --> 11:59:06,480
that screen that sorry this is not a dialogue this

10
11:59:06,480 --> 11:59:11,040
is actually a view so we're going to go to forgot password view

11
11:59:11,040 --> 11:59:14,872
here i mean when it comes to views our job is a little bit more difficult

12
11:59:14,872 --> 11:59:18,400
because up until this point we've pretty much everywhere

13
11:59:18,400 --> 11:59:22,640
used constants like if you look at this is a constant string here's a constant

14
11:59:22,640 --> 11:59:26,400
text here is constant so everywhere that

15
11:59:26,400 --> 11:59:31,272
we're going to localize our strings and we were using const before we have to

16
11:59:31,272 --> 11:59:35,512
remove that cons now because our localized properties inside arv funds

17
11:59:35,512 --> 11:59:40,720
are unfortunately not defined as const and i don't really know the reasoning

18
11:59:40,720 --> 11:59:43,272
behind that simply maybe because there are

19
11:59:43,272 --> 11:59:47,272
getters and maybe getters can't be constant or there are some

20
11:59:47,272 --> 11:59:53,192
other problems with the generation maybe that um the flutter team decided that

21
11:59:53,192 --> 11:59:56,800
well these can't be constants but that's something that's the truth that we have

22
11:59:56,800 --> 12:00:01,440
to live with at the moment so let's go ahead and find all our strings

23
12:00:01,440 --> 12:00:06,232
and we're going to start localizing them one at a time before i got password view

24
12:00:06,232 --> 12:00:11,360
so here in this show error dialog and i've called this key forgot password

25
12:00:11,360 --> 12:00:15,912
view generic error so let's remove this string and just say

26
12:00:15,912 --> 12:00:19,832
context lock let's auto import log

27
12:00:19,832 --> 12:00:25,272
and we say forgot password

28
12:00:25,272 --> 12:00:29,040
view generic error and i'm going to put a comma at the end so it's formatted

29
12:00:29,040 --> 12:00:33,832
nicely so let's go to this forgot password title itself so i'm gonna

30
12:00:33,832 --> 12:00:36,720
remove the const remember i just explained that so we're gonna say

31
12:00:36,720 --> 12:00:41,040
context log and we're gonna say forgot password that's the key i've defined

32
12:00:41,040 --> 12:00:45,360
and you can also see its description here and you can see it says forgot

33
12:00:45,360 --> 12:00:49,040
password okay in english this message translates to

34
12:00:49,040 --> 12:00:54,320
forgot password okay so this thing i've called it forgot

35
12:00:54,320 --> 12:00:59,360
password view prompt so let's remove the const remove the string itself and we're

36
12:00:59,360 --> 12:01:01,912
going to say

37
12:01:01,912 --> 12:01:07,272
context log forgot password prompt forgot password view prompt and put a

38
12:01:07,272 --> 12:01:10,552
comma at the end and let's have a look at the documentation for this as you can

39
12:01:10,552 --> 12:01:13,360
see it says if you forgot your password simply enter your email and we'll send

40
12:01:13,360 --> 12:01:17,592
you a password recent link okay so that's one thing and then in your

41
12:01:17,592 --> 12:01:21,360
email address um it says input decoration your email

42
12:01:21,360 --> 12:01:24,480
address because that's a forgot password screen let's go here and have a look at

43
12:01:24,480 --> 12:01:29,832
it see how it looks like here i forgot my password so here's that

44
12:01:29,832 --> 12:01:32,640
little input decoration so

45
12:01:32,640 --> 12:01:37,040
i can see i've called it email text field placeholder so let's remove this

46
12:01:37,040 --> 12:01:42,232
const and in here we're going to say context log email placeholder text field

47
12:01:42,232 --> 12:01:45,360
okay let's go ahead and have a look at this

48
12:01:45,360 --> 12:01:50,720
one so let's remove the const it says send me password recent link and i can

49
12:01:50,720 --> 12:01:57,760
see that i've called that forgot password view send me link so

50
12:01:57,760 --> 12:02:04,552
context log for god password forgot send me link here and put a comma at the

51
12:02:04,552 --> 12:02:08,800
end so the dart formatter gets busy with formatting the code and

52
12:02:08,800 --> 12:02:13,040
in here back to login view i can see that i've called it forgot

53
12:02:13,040 --> 12:02:17,912
password view back to login so context

54
12:02:17,912 --> 12:02:21,360
here context lock forgot

55
12:02:21,360 --> 12:02:25,592
back okay so and this is this is a technique that you can also use like if

56
12:02:25,592 --> 12:02:28,552
you want to get like a property like this that's quite long name and you want

57
12:02:28,552 --> 12:02:33,040
to get the name immediately right you could just write a few keywords of that

58
12:02:33,040 --> 12:02:37,272
name for instance i know that for god and back are quite unique names so if i

59
12:02:37,272 --> 12:02:41,272
say forgot back it it's gonna show me that so

60
12:02:41,272 --> 12:02:45,440
it has this like partial search kind of in its intelligence which is very very

61
12:02:45,440 --> 12:02:49,360
useful the next thing that we have to do is to

62
12:02:49,360 --> 12:02:53,360
go ahead and localize our login view so i'm going to close the screen forgot

63
12:02:53,360 --> 12:02:57,680
password view and go to login view login view right here and we're going to

64
12:02:57,680 --> 12:03:00,480
start at the bottom at the top of the screen and

65
12:03:00,480 --> 12:03:04,480
we'll remove this unused import right there in login view

66
12:03:04,480 --> 12:03:09,512
and let's go ahead and start by uh localizing our dialogs so the first one

67
12:03:09,512 --> 12:03:13,040
is cannot find a user with the entered credentials and i've called it cannot

68
12:03:13,040 --> 12:03:16,320
find user or login view cannot find user so i'm

69
12:03:16,320 --> 12:03:22,960
just going to say context.log let's auto import log

70
12:03:22,960 --> 12:03:27,440
or it was already imported okay that's great and let's just say it is called

71
12:03:27,440 --> 12:03:31,832
login error cannot find user cannot find user okay

72
12:03:31,832 --> 12:03:35,360
the next one i'm going to put some commas in here get dark formatter to do

73
12:03:35,360 --> 12:03:38,800
its job correctly and i'm going to press command s to save the file and that's

74
12:03:38,800 --> 12:03:42,552
going to format the file for me for wrong credentials i've called it login

75
12:03:42,552 --> 12:03:48,480
error wrong credentials so context log and wrong credentials

76
12:03:48,480 --> 12:03:52,640
next one is authentication error and we just call it login error author so

77
12:03:52,640 --> 12:03:59,680
context lock author okay so that's that one as well now at the top of the login

78
12:03:59,680 --> 12:04:02,640
login view we have this little text that says please log in your account in order

79
12:04:02,640 --> 12:04:07,040
to interact with and create notes and this one i can see

80
12:04:07,040 --> 12:04:11,832
i've just called a login view prompt but i wonder what

81
12:04:11,832 --> 12:04:16,720
happened to our title as you can see we have this my title now that we're in the

82
12:04:16,720 --> 12:04:20,080
login view it is a good time to actually go and get rid of that okay so i'm going

83
12:04:20,080 --> 12:04:23,592
to open um intel

84
12:04:23,592 --> 12:04:27,512
e and arb and i'm going to kill this basically my

85
12:04:27,512 --> 12:04:33,760
title and i suggest that you also go to the swedish file which is intel sv and

86
12:04:33,760 --> 12:04:37,760
kill this title as well okay so we've removed that and i'm gonna get rid of

87
12:04:37,760 --> 12:04:41,592
that then i'm gonna hot restart so that the code generation

88
12:04:41,592 --> 12:04:46,552
kicks in and as you can see in here my title isn't valid anymore and in this i

89
12:04:46,552 --> 12:04:50,480
mean this title is called now login if you can look at the documentation in

90
12:04:50,480 --> 12:04:54,552
here you can see in english it just says login fantastic

91
12:04:54,552 --> 12:04:59,440
so let's remove this constant here from the prompt as well and we're just going

92
12:04:59,440 --> 12:05:04,480
to say context lock and let's just say login prompt so i'm going to do a prompt

93
12:05:04,480 --> 12:05:09,680
okay so for the enter email um

94
12:05:09,680 --> 12:05:14,000
text field placeholder here enter your email here we're gonna remove the const

95
12:05:14,000 --> 12:05:19,912
and let's just say context lock and we're gonna say email placeholder

96
12:05:19,912 --> 12:05:22,960
okay and we also have an enter your password

97
12:05:22,960 --> 12:05:26,800
here placeholder so let's remove the cons in here i'm just gonna say context

98
12:05:26,800 --> 12:05:30,400
lock password

99
12:05:30,400 --> 12:05:35,040
placeholder okay password field password text field placeholder that's the full

100
12:05:35,040 --> 12:05:40,000
name and we have this uh login in here so

101
12:05:40,000 --> 12:05:44,080
what we need to do is just to change this text as well so let's remove the

102
12:05:44,080 --> 12:05:49,360
content here i'm just gonna say context dot walk

103
12:05:49,360 --> 12:05:53,912
login and i forgot my password so i'm going to

104
12:05:53,912 --> 12:05:59,832
say context lock and i believe it's called forgot password

105
12:05:59,832 --> 12:06:04,640
login view forgot password okay it's not a constant anymore and put a

106
12:06:04,640 --> 12:06:07,832
comma here it's just good practice to put comma at the end of your parameters

107
12:06:07,832 --> 12:06:12,000
even if it's just one argument that you're passing to a function i mean my

108
12:06:12,000 --> 12:06:15,680
reason this is a little bit of a side though but my reasoning is that any time

109
12:06:15,680 --> 12:06:20,232
in the future anybody anybody wants to add new parameters to this text widget

110
12:06:20,232 --> 12:06:23,680
then they will have to go and put that comma in there but if you as a

111
12:06:23,680 --> 12:06:27,192
programmer who wrote this code in the beginning you put the comma in there

112
12:06:27,192 --> 12:06:30,800
you're kind of like acknowledging the fact that hey i appreciate your time you

113
12:06:30,800 --> 12:06:34,800
may be wanting to add now you may be wanting to add new parameters to this

114
12:06:34,800 --> 12:06:39,360
and i've already prepared this for you so if you don't do this if i want to as

115
12:06:39,360 --> 12:06:43,120
a programmer add new parameters in here i have to go and say oh well okay comma

116
12:06:43,120 --> 12:06:46,872
commandments go here blah blah but if you'd added that already i'll

117
12:06:46,872 --> 12:06:53,832
just say enter and then write my parameters

118
12:06:53,832 --> 12:06:59,192
okay great so what we can do now is to scroll forward here and localize the

119
12:06:59,192 --> 12:07:02,872
rest of these properties and it can't i can just see here that we have one

120
12:07:02,872 --> 12:07:07,272
property left here which at the moment says not registered yet registered here

121
12:07:07,272 --> 12:07:11,512
so let's go ahead and remove the const as we usually do then and say contacts

122
12:07:11,512 --> 12:07:15,760
lock and i can see it's called not registered

123
12:07:15,760 --> 12:07:19,760
so let's use that and a comma here so we prepared for the next programmer so to

124
12:07:19,760 --> 12:07:23,272
say and we could just say now that we have

125
12:07:23,272 --> 12:07:27,592
successfully localized our login view at the moment so we could just close this

126
12:07:27,592 --> 12:07:31,912
tab the next step is to localize our

127
12:07:31,912 --> 12:07:36,872
register view so the register view also has quite a few things that we have to

128
12:07:36,872 --> 12:07:40,400
localize so let's go ahead and go to register view

129
12:07:40,400 --> 12:07:44,400
and while we're here i mean this is what i'm again i

130
12:07:44,400 --> 12:07:47,680
when i started this course i wanted you to become a software engineer even if

131
12:07:47,680 --> 12:07:51,512
you were like a designer a ux or whatever or project

132
12:07:51,512 --> 12:07:55,760
manager and you have to put yourself and your yourself in the shoes of a software

133
12:07:55,760 --> 12:08:00,160
developer software developer you're always in like time constraint usually

134
12:08:00,160 --> 12:08:03,512
our time concern to deliver but at the same time

135
12:08:03,512 --> 12:08:08,480
when you stumble upon something that is quickly fixed please do it on

136
12:08:08,480 --> 12:08:11,912
right there uh at that point because if you leave these things they're gonna

137
12:08:11,912 --> 12:08:15,512
pile up and many small things that could be

138
12:08:15,512 --> 12:08:19,592
corrected on the fly if you just leave them they're gonna become a big pile and

139
12:08:19,592 --> 12:08:23,360
then you're not gonna be able to have enough time to fix them all so while

140
12:08:23,360 --> 12:08:26,640
we're here we have two unused imports let's just remove them because that's

141
12:08:26,640 --> 12:08:30,480
just good practice not to have unused imports

142
12:08:30,480 --> 12:08:33,760
now let's go to our register view here we can see there's quite a lot of errors

143
12:08:33,760 --> 12:08:37,912
there are four errors so the first thing i'm gonna do is to put commas at the end

144
12:08:37,912 --> 12:08:40,552
of these right there and i'm going to press

145
12:08:40,552 --> 12:08:44,720
command s on macintosh or control s on windows linux and that's going to do the

146
12:08:44,720 --> 12:08:48,080
formatting the first one is called weak password so

147
12:08:48,080 --> 12:08:53,192
let's just say context lock and also import this

148
12:08:53,192 --> 12:08:58,400
and this message is register error weak password so weak password

149
12:08:58,400 --> 12:09:02,800
like that the next one is called context log and

150
12:09:02,800 --> 12:09:10,480
it's called an email already in use okay fail to register i've called register

151
12:09:10,480 --> 12:09:12,720
error generic

152
12:09:12,720 --> 12:09:16,400
so context lock generic

153
12:09:16,400 --> 12:09:22,320
here it's register error generic and this invalid email is called context

154
12:09:22,320 --> 12:09:27,440
lock and register invalid email okay so those are our errors we didn't have

155
12:09:27,440 --> 12:09:30,960
to change anything with constant because these messages weren't constant when

156
12:09:30,960 --> 12:09:34,872
they were passed into this constructor

157
12:09:34,872 --> 12:09:39,512
then we have to fix this register's title and it's just called a register so

158
12:09:39,512 --> 12:09:44,320
i'm going to remove the con const i'm going to say context log register

159
12:09:44,320 --> 12:09:47,760
here and then we have enter your email and

160
12:09:47,760 --> 12:09:52,720
password to see your notes and i've called that the register view prompt

161
12:09:52,720 --> 12:09:58,960
so context lock register view prompt we have this input declaration again

162
12:09:58,960 --> 12:10:03,272
we've done this before with the email and password so it's nothing surprising

163
12:10:03,272 --> 12:10:08,320
so let's just say context block email placeholder and this one is

164
12:10:08,320 --> 12:10:11,912
a password placeholder so let's remove the const

165
12:10:11,912 --> 12:10:18,960
a context lock password placeholder all right so that's that

166
12:10:18,960 --> 12:10:22,800
then we have the register button that we also have to

167
12:10:22,800 --> 12:10:27,512
localize and let's remove the constant here and just say context

168
12:10:27,512 --> 12:10:31,760
lock register and already registered is called already

169
12:10:31,760 --> 12:10:35,912
registered so let's remove the constant const as well

170
12:10:35,912 --> 12:10:39,592
and we say context lock already registered

171
12:10:39,592 --> 12:10:43,040
all right and a comma at the end as well and we could do the same thing in here

172
12:10:43,040 --> 12:10:46,552
with a comma at the end just to do the formatting right okay

173
12:10:46,552 --> 12:10:51,440
so this seems to be ready we've now localized the register view

174
12:10:51,440 --> 12:10:55,680
and the next step is to localize the verify email view so i'm going to close

175
12:10:55,680 --> 12:11:00,000
this file and let's go ahead to verify email view

176
12:11:00,000 --> 12:11:04,800
and again we have two unused imports let's remove those and let's go ahead to

177
12:11:04,800 --> 12:11:08,960
verify email in here and we've just called it verify email so i'm removing

178
12:11:08,960 --> 12:11:14,080
removing const saying context of lock and

179
12:11:14,080 --> 12:11:18,960
let's say verify email okay and this is one thing that i've also fixed and you

180
12:11:18,960 --> 12:11:23,120
could see that in how we've developed the application so far we have two

181
12:11:23,120 --> 12:11:27,192
texts on top of the verify email view and they kind of look like this if i

182
12:11:27,192 --> 12:11:30,160
bring it up let's go to

183
12:11:30,160 --> 12:11:33,440
try to log in with a user who hasn't verified

184
12:11:33,440 --> 12:11:36,872
his email

185
12:11:36,872 --> 12:11:39,760
and you can see we end up here we've sent you an email verification please

186
12:11:39,760 --> 12:11:43,512
open it to verify your account and this is like there are two text

187
12:11:43,512 --> 12:11:48,640
fields but what i've done is i've made it one text prompt so let's just remove

188
12:11:48,640 --> 12:11:54,640
the second text field and the way i've created this it's um if we go to our

189
12:11:54,640 --> 12:11:59,680
intel en rb and if you look at the verify

190
12:11:59,680 --> 12:12:03,192
prompt you can see i've written we've sent you an email verification please

191
12:12:03,192 --> 12:12:06,232
open on your open it to verify your account and then

192
12:12:06,232 --> 12:12:11,040
the rest of the string it just follows along so it's just one paragraph

193
12:12:11,040 --> 12:12:15,192
and so that's why we're removing the second text in here

194
12:12:15,192 --> 12:12:19,440
so and we're gonna remove this const i'm gonna remove the text

195
12:12:19,440 --> 12:12:23,760
and then we're going to say context lock

196
12:12:23,760 --> 12:12:28,400
verify prompt okay and a comma

197
12:12:28,400 --> 12:12:32,720
we have this a little text button in here that says send email verification

198
12:12:32,720 --> 12:12:37,440
and this looks like this let's change that as well and here we're

199
12:12:37,440 --> 12:12:41,192
gonna say context lock

200
12:12:41,192 --> 12:12:47,592
and it is called verify send email verification put a comma here

201
12:12:47,592 --> 12:12:50,160
okay and for the restart button we have a

202
12:12:50,160 --> 12:12:54,480
restart text so we're just going to say context log restart

203
12:12:54,480 --> 12:12:59,360
and a comma at the end all right so that's the localization of this

204
12:12:59,360 --> 12:13:04,080
screen as well so we could say we're pretty much done with the verify email

205
12:13:04,080 --> 12:13:08,232
localization as well and while we're here to be honest with

206
12:13:08,232 --> 12:13:12,232
you we could also clean up a little bit here in this verify email while we're

207
12:13:12,232 --> 12:13:16,800
basically cleaning up the view itself you can see that this text doesn't have

208
12:13:16,800 --> 12:13:21,832
any padding what we could do is to in this whole column actually

209
12:13:21,832 --> 12:13:26,232
maybe pad this text so we're going to say this text is padded wrap it with a

210
12:13:26,232 --> 12:13:29,832
padding okay and we could just say padding of 16. so

211
12:13:29,832 --> 12:13:33,832
you can see now it is a little bit cleaner it's just a very little uh

212
12:13:33,832 --> 12:13:37,832
effort to make the the ui look a lot cleaner okay

213
12:13:37,832 --> 12:13:42,640
so we're done with that screen and what we need to do um we need to actually

214
12:13:42,640 --> 12:13:46,720
localize the create update node view so let's go ahead to create update note

215
12:13:46,720 --> 12:13:50,960
view another unused import let's remove that

216
12:13:50,960 --> 12:13:54,320
and let's have a look at what exactly we have to

217
12:13:54,320 --> 12:13:58,720
localize in here it's probably the the views title so if we scroll down to

218
12:13:58,720 --> 12:14:02,480
where we're displaying the new note so if i log in with the user who has

219
12:14:02,480 --> 12:14:06,640
verified his email address this user

220
12:14:06,640 --> 12:14:09,272
our baz horrible password please don't use that

221
12:14:09,272 --> 12:14:12,400
password at the moment you can see in here

222
12:14:12,400 --> 12:14:17,040
we're basically saying um sorry new note here

223
12:14:17,040 --> 12:14:21,912
we're saying new note and that's this thing so let's just change that and say

224
12:14:21,912 --> 12:14:26,640
context dot lock auto import disk oops how to

225
12:14:26,640 --> 12:14:30,640
import this and then we're just going to say note

226
12:14:30,640 --> 12:14:33,440
okay and you can see in the documentation it

227
12:14:33,440 --> 12:14:37,440
says it just in the english one says note so here we're not saying new notes

228
12:14:37,440 --> 12:14:40,552
and the reason behind that is that up until this point our application is

229
12:14:40,552 --> 12:14:45,360
being say new notes but what happens if you tap on an existing note

230
12:14:45,360 --> 12:14:48,872
it still says new note so that's the reason i've decided to basically change

231
12:14:48,872 --> 12:14:52,800
this text just to say note and put a comma in here to prepare for

232
12:14:52,800 --> 12:14:56,320
the next person as well and what we're going to do and is also

233
12:14:56,320 --> 12:15:01,440
to change this text decoration and which is here it says start typing your note

234
12:15:01,440 --> 12:15:06,720
okay so remove the const and then in here we call it start typing

235
12:15:06,720 --> 12:15:11,512
your note so context log start typing your note

236
12:15:11,512 --> 12:15:15,360
all right great so we're going to save that as well

237
12:15:15,360 --> 12:15:20,320
and we're done with that so now we're going to go to localizing our

238
12:15:20,320 --> 12:15:24,080
notes view and this is i would say this is like the most exciting localization

239
12:15:24,080 --> 12:15:28,232
part because we need to do some more coding it's not

240
12:15:28,232 --> 12:15:33,120
as easy so for just two just to because remember in

241
12:15:33,120 --> 12:15:37,360
the beginning of this chapter i mentioned that arb files are more than

242
12:15:37,360 --> 12:15:41,680
just normal json in that they can have logic in them and at the moment if we go

243
12:15:41,680 --> 12:15:46,960
back to our let's see if i bring scr cpy here at the

244
12:15:46,960 --> 12:15:49,592
moment you can see it just says your notes

245
12:15:49,592 --> 12:15:53,592
and i wanted to kind of demonstrate how arb files can be quite dynamic and can

246
12:15:53,592 --> 12:15:57,272
have logic in them and i thought okay how do i demonstrate that to you and

247
12:15:57,272 --> 12:16:00,232
what i decided to do is um

248
12:16:00,232 --> 12:16:02,480
that if you

249
12:16:02,480 --> 12:16:06,720
land in this page and you have no notes like in this case at the moment it says

250
12:16:06,720 --> 12:16:12,160
your notes but what we're gonna do is to say okay we have some some key in our

251
12:16:12,160 --> 12:16:17,272
localization file that is called your notes okay or sorry it's called notes

252
12:16:17,272 --> 12:16:20,552
title is a key but this key is going to have

253
12:16:20,552 --> 12:16:25,160
some value that has actual logic in it and this logic has to do with the plural

254
12:16:25,160 --> 12:16:29,832
pluralization of this key if you have no notes

255
12:16:29,832 --> 12:16:33,760
in english we're going to say no notes yet

256
12:16:33,760 --> 12:16:38,800
if you have one note it's just gonna say one note

257
12:16:38,800 --> 12:16:43,192
and if you have other number of notes such as two three

258
12:16:43,192 --> 12:16:46,832
four then it's going to say x

259
12:16:46,832 --> 12:16:51,192
notes for instance x being three notes four notes so it's just gonna say four

260
12:16:51,192 --> 12:16:56,640
notes so no notes yet one note or x notes

261
12:16:56,640 --> 12:17:02,000
so it has pluralization built into it and how we have to do that is to use

262
12:17:02,000 --> 12:17:07,360
something in arb called placeholders and i'll show you how to do that right now

263
12:17:07,360 --> 12:17:13,192
so let's go ahead first into our intel en

264
12:17:13,192 --> 12:17:16,160
and at the bottom of the screen here what we're going to do is to first

265
12:17:16,160 --> 12:17:18,552
create our key so that's the most important one okay so we're going to

266
12:17:18,552 --> 12:17:21,512
call it notes title and in here we know that we're going to

267
12:17:21,512 --> 12:17:27,912
have some value and let's see we have also a semi sorry a colon there okay

268
12:17:27,912 --> 12:17:33,040
so we have notes title how do we put our logic in here

269
12:17:33,040 --> 12:17:38,320
we just know that we need to have some sort of a

270
12:17:38,320 --> 12:17:42,480
account you see your localization arb file doesn't know

271
12:17:42,480 --> 12:17:46,320
anything about the count because it's the application that knows how many

272
12:17:46,320 --> 12:17:50,000
nodes are available in the in the fire store database so

273
12:17:50,000 --> 12:17:54,232
somehow we need to pass this count to our application

274
12:17:54,232 --> 12:17:59,192
sorry to our arb file and you do that with parameterization so you go ahead

275
12:17:59,192 --> 12:18:03,040
and create curly brackets in here and you would say okay hey i want to have a

276
12:18:03,040 --> 12:18:08,552
parameter called count this count needs to be passed to this

277
12:18:08,552 --> 12:18:12,000
um notes title in order for it to be able

278
12:18:12,000 --> 12:18:15,592
to calculate exactly what it has to return so it's just you

279
12:18:15,592 --> 12:18:20,800
saying that hey application if you want to get the notes title localized string

280
12:18:20,800 --> 12:18:24,720
you have to pass a parameter to me call count okay

281
12:18:24,720 --> 12:18:29,360
now what we're going to do is to go and call and basically and create discount

282
12:18:29,360 --> 12:18:33,680
as a parameter so what you have to do is to go to the next line and just say adds

283
12:18:33,680 --> 12:18:38,320
notes title this is how you tell arb that hey

284
12:18:38,320 --> 12:18:43,512
this notes title key has some extra logic in it okay

285
12:18:43,512 --> 12:18:46,872
then there is a key in here called placeholders

286
12:18:46,872 --> 12:18:51,760
so you have to write placeholders okay and in here basically you say

287
12:18:51,760 --> 12:18:57,760
placeholders and then every key is the name of the parameter itself so account

288
12:18:57,760 --> 12:19:02,000
all right and then you basically start that and then what you have to do is you

289
12:19:02,000 --> 12:19:04,960
have to define two keys in here one is a type

290
12:19:04,960 --> 12:19:09,272
and the oops type and then the other one is an

291
12:19:09,272 --> 12:19:11,912
example

292
12:19:11,912 --> 12:19:16,080
like this so let's have a look at how this actually looks like

293
12:19:16,080 --> 12:19:19,120
so basically what we're telling and

294
12:19:19,120 --> 12:19:24,960
arb is that or dart in this case we're saying that hey this notes title key in

295
12:19:24,960 --> 12:19:31,040
our arab has a parameter called count and in in here we're saying hey

296
12:19:31,040 --> 12:19:34,160
these are the placeholders the name it's count and it's type now you have to

297
12:19:34,160 --> 12:19:36,800
define a type you have to actually tell dart that hey

298
12:19:36,800 --> 12:19:40,232
what data type is this using is it a string is it's an integer is it a

299
12:19:40,232 --> 12:19:44,320
boolean what is it so in here you just say it's an integer and then as you'll

300
12:19:44,320 --> 12:19:49,680
see soon the code generation then has a look at this and says okay i expect you

301
12:19:49,680 --> 12:19:53,680
to send an integer and it's going to create a function called node's title

302
12:19:53,680 --> 12:19:58,480
with account a parameter of type integer so this is very important it's the data

303
12:19:58,480 --> 12:20:03,512
type of that count parameter okay and an example is just for you to know

304
12:20:03,512 --> 12:20:07,592
okay how is this going to be used so an example is for instance three nodes okay

305
12:20:07,592 --> 12:20:10,400
so we're just going to say here's an example of how the result of this thing

306
12:20:10,400 --> 12:20:13,832
can look like right

307
12:20:13,832 --> 12:20:20,080
so what we need to do now is to tell this um erb and dart code generator here

308
12:20:20,080 --> 12:20:25,592
that this count actually has a logic about it being plural so it has

309
12:20:25,592 --> 12:20:29,440
pluralization logic and the way to do that is you put a comma here and you say

310
12:20:29,440 --> 12:20:33,592
plural and a comma after that because then you have to specify the logic for

311
12:20:33,592 --> 12:20:36,640
that pluralization so and look

312
12:20:36,640 --> 12:20:41,272
as a side note i completely understand that this is so weird i mean it is a

313
12:20:41,272 --> 12:20:46,480
strange syntax i don't feel comfortable with it i sometimes use i sometimes look

314
12:20:46,480 --> 12:20:49,120
at the documentation just to be a reminder of this

315
12:20:49,120 --> 12:20:52,960
logic but the way i look at it is that it's the best thing we have let's not

316
12:20:52,960 --> 12:20:57,272
hate on it let's just use it let's understand that it has power there are

317
12:20:57,272 --> 12:21:02,400
reasons for it being the way it is and even though we are not 100

318
12:21:02,400 --> 12:21:04,232
like in

319
12:21:04,232 --> 12:21:07,192
in we weren't involved in the reasoning of this we don't even know what the

320
12:21:07,192 --> 12:21:10,320
reasoning is but this is what the format is and this is what we have to basically

321
12:21:10,320 --> 12:21:16,480
go with so the way to create this is for you to

322
12:21:16,480 --> 12:21:19,120
uh have your logic in here so we're going

323
12:21:19,120 --> 12:21:25,360
to say equal to zero and let's just do it like this and then

324
12:21:25,360 --> 12:21:30,080
we're gonna say equal to one and then we're gonna say other

325
12:21:30,080 --> 12:21:33,440
okay so this is how you create it so you're

326
12:21:33,440 --> 12:21:37,592
saying that if the value of this count is zero

327
12:21:37,592 --> 12:21:42,800
then we are going to do something here if the value of that count is one we're

328
12:21:42,800 --> 12:21:46,800
gonna do something here and if it's anything else denoted by other we're

329
12:21:46,800 --> 12:21:50,960
gonna do something in here so let's say when it's equal to zero we're gonna say

330
12:21:50,960 --> 12:21:54,160
no notes yet okay so that's the string

331
12:21:54,160 --> 12:21:58,872
we're gonna display if the count is zero if it's equal to one we're just going to

332
12:21:58,872 --> 12:22:03,192
say one note and then the important thing is if we

333
12:22:03,192 --> 12:22:07,360
end up in this situation if it's other then we want to say in this case we

334
12:22:07,360 --> 12:22:11,592
actually want to get the count so if you pass the value of three we want to say

335
12:22:11,592 --> 12:22:16,400
three notes so the way to get that count is with another curly bracket pair and

336
12:22:16,400 --> 12:22:20,000
you say count and then you say notes okay

337
12:22:20,000 --> 12:22:25,680
so that's how you create these things so um and i think we're actually missing a

338
12:22:25,680 --> 12:22:31,120
curly bracket and that is the the curly bracket at the end yes

339
12:22:31,120 --> 12:22:34,800
this curly bracket which belongs to like if we

340
12:22:34,800 --> 12:22:40,232
if you look here if i remove these

341
12:22:40,232 --> 12:22:43,832
the other has two curly brackets and

342
12:22:43,832 --> 12:22:49,592
it's two curly brackets and here other one curly bracket there one curly

343
12:22:49,592 --> 12:22:55,440
bracket here one ends here and one ends here so this last curly bracket here is

344
12:22:55,440 --> 12:23:00,400
for the curly bracket that started here so again i i don't know what to say this

345
12:23:00,400 --> 12:23:04,960
is the format the way it is we just have to live with it okay so we've created

346
12:23:04,960 --> 12:23:08,640
the notes title and what we're going to do is to go ahead and do the same thing

347
12:23:08,640 --> 12:23:12,480
but for swedish and i've already prepared that so i'm just going to go

348
12:23:12,480 --> 12:23:16,232
ahead and grab that string from the swedish one that i've

349
12:23:16,232 --> 12:23:20,552
already made so we don't have to type all that again

350
12:23:20,552 --> 12:23:23,592
so let me go and grab that and bring it into

351
12:23:23,592 --> 12:23:27,592
l10n sv which is for swedish and then bring

352
12:23:27,592 --> 12:23:32,080
it at the bottom of the screen and paste it right there and with a

353
12:23:32,080 --> 12:23:37,680
comma at the end of that line so you can see plural and it says no notes yet

354
12:23:37,680 --> 12:23:42,080
for one it says one note and for other it just says

355
12:23:42,080 --> 12:23:45,272
x notes all right

356
12:23:45,272 --> 12:23:48,960
so i'm gonna save this i'm gonna save this and i'm gonna do a hot restart

357
12:23:48,960 --> 12:23:52,800
let's just hope that scr cpy doesn't crash and it didn't

358
12:23:52,800 --> 12:23:57,272
so what we're gonna do now is i was as it was planned we're gonna go to our

359
12:23:57,272 --> 12:24:00,160
notes view and i'm gonna go to my notes as well

360
12:24:00,160 --> 12:24:05,912
here let's go to notes view and have a look at our title in here

361
12:24:05,912 --> 12:24:09,832
and you see we at the moment we're seeing your notes but what we really

362
12:24:09,832 --> 12:24:14,080
want is to be able to display the number of notes that are

363
12:24:14,080 --> 12:24:20,000
inside our um inside the nodes provider so if we have

364
12:24:20,000 --> 12:24:23,120
a look at how we're reading the num and the notes you can see we're using the

365
12:24:23,120 --> 12:24:27,192
note service and then we're saying all nodes and this is a stream

366
12:24:27,192 --> 12:24:32,232
of an i triple of cloud nodes so we kind of wanted stream builder we want a

367
12:24:32,232 --> 12:24:36,560
stream builder to create our title our app bar and we're going to exactly do

368
12:24:36,560 --> 12:24:40,080
the same thing so we're going to have a stream builder that creates our app bar

369
12:24:40,080 --> 12:24:42,000
okay but

370
12:24:42,000 --> 12:24:46,800
or actually it's going to create the text but how do we get the count of

371
12:24:46,800 --> 12:24:50,640
the notes and the way to do that is with a little handy extension that i'm going

372
12:24:50,640 --> 12:24:56,232
to show you how to create so let's go in here in our notes view and

373
12:24:56,232 --> 12:25:00,232
we're going to say extension and we're going to say count

374
12:25:00,232 --> 12:25:04,720
and we want to create it on a stream so we're going to say any stream has to be

375
12:25:04,720 --> 12:25:08,560
able to like any stream that has an iterable in it

376
12:25:08,560 --> 12:25:12,952
that its values are iterable we want to create a

377
12:25:12,952 --> 12:25:17,112
property called length for instance that it gets the length so

378
12:25:17,112 --> 12:25:22,080
let's go in here and say okay this stream has some value but we want that

379
12:25:22,080 --> 12:25:24,872
value to be iterable

380
12:25:24,872 --> 12:25:30,640
okay so here we're basically saying that we're extending any stream that contains

381
12:25:30,640 --> 12:25:35,440
uh i troubles as its value is gonna have this extension

382
12:25:35,440 --> 12:25:38,872
then we're gonna say okay the value of this is gonna be an hint

383
12:25:38,872 --> 12:25:43,280
and we're going to call it get links okay

384
12:25:43,280 --> 12:25:46,000
and what this is basically going to do is to

385
12:25:46,000 --> 12:25:51,440
say it maps the stream's values so let's say event

386
12:25:51,440 --> 12:25:55,672
and in here we just say it returns the event's length so i understand this may

387
12:25:55,672 --> 12:25:59,032
be a little bit cryptic for you to understand but um

388
12:25:59,032 --> 12:26:04,640
you have to know that every stream is a generic function like if you sorry

389
12:26:04,640 --> 12:26:08,800
it's a generic class you can see it's abstract class it's it has a parameter

390
12:26:08,800 --> 12:26:13,840
called t which is it's generic type so what we're saying here we're saying that

391
12:26:13,840 --> 12:26:18,872
okay we're creating an extension on any stream whose parameters or whose types

392
12:26:18,872 --> 12:26:22,392
are and i treble and iterable has a length

393
12:26:22,392 --> 12:26:26,488
and that means that we can then extend and extend any stream that has an i

394
12:26:26,488 --> 12:26:30,800
treble and then we return its property called get length okay

395
12:26:30,800 --> 12:26:37,200
so what we need to do now is to go ahead and inside the app bar in here

396
12:26:37,200 --> 12:26:41,920
we have a const text when we need to remove this const first actually let's

397
12:26:41,920 --> 12:26:46,232
keep it and i'm gonna see if we can wrap this with a stream

398
12:26:46,232 --> 12:26:50,800
builder now okay so in here what we're gonna do is we're saying here's a stream

399
12:26:50,800 --> 12:26:55,200
builder and we don't yet know what it is it's stream is

400
12:26:55,200 --> 12:27:01,280
note service like this and we have all notes

401
12:27:01,280 --> 12:27:08,160
and the owner user id is our user id okay as exactly as we have it here

402
12:27:08,160 --> 12:27:11,672
okay but here the stream we don't actually want the notes we want the

403
12:27:11,672 --> 12:27:14,952
length of notes so let's just say get length

404
12:27:14,952 --> 12:27:21,032
where is it here get length okay and now we know that snapshot can then

405
12:27:21,032 --> 12:27:26,872
return that uh value for us so if i press command s in here let's put a

406
12:27:26,872 --> 12:27:31,032
comma here as well you can see nothing has changed it just

407
12:27:31,032 --> 12:27:34,000
says your notes because we're still seeing your notes in here okay but what

408
12:27:34,000 --> 12:27:39,032
we want is to grab the data out of our snapshot and this snapshot is an async

409
12:27:39,032 --> 12:27:42,640
snapshot of an integer

410
12:27:42,640 --> 12:27:47,920
let's see undefined class it's called async snapshots yeah just like that all

411
12:27:47,920 --> 12:27:50,952
right so you either could tell a stream

412
12:27:50,952 --> 12:27:54,160
builder of int and then your snapshot i believe

413
12:27:54,160 --> 12:27:59,112
automatically will be as facing snatch out of it or you could

414
12:27:59,112 --> 12:28:02,800
just say stream builder normal stream builder and an async snapshot of it so

415
12:28:02,800 --> 12:28:06,312
you could type it in two different ways and i've just chosen to do it this way

416
12:28:06,312 --> 12:28:09,920
all right what we need to do in here is to see as

417
12:28:09,920 --> 12:28:14,640
soon as snapshot has data then we grab that data which means it has the length

418
12:28:14,640 --> 12:28:19,752
built into it okay so we're going to say if snapshot has

419
12:28:19,752 --> 12:28:24,160
data which means it has length otherwise we're just going to return

420
12:28:24,160 --> 12:28:29,112
const of text nothing meaning that well well we don't have anything to display

421
12:28:29,112 --> 12:28:32,640
at the top of the screen if this snapshot has no text all right

422
12:28:32,640 --> 12:28:36,488
and then in here we're going to say it's going to say final note count

423
12:28:36,488 --> 12:28:40,312
is snapchat date okay

424
12:28:40,312 --> 12:28:44,640
or zero because it just says yeah i may not have data

425
12:28:44,640 --> 12:28:47,440
just strange because you're actually saying has data but these two properties

426
12:28:47,440 --> 12:28:50,000
are kind of like they're different from you i mean

427
12:28:50,000 --> 12:28:53,032
they're not different but they're separated from each other just because

428
12:28:53,032 --> 12:28:56,312
you're checking something has data doesn't mean necessarily that the next

429
12:28:56,312 --> 12:29:00,000
line should understand that it has data the data type

430
12:29:00,000 --> 12:29:04,800
of this data property is still final t so you can't change that okay and that's

431
12:29:04,800 --> 12:29:08,392
why we have this um elvis sign kind of here

432
12:29:08,392 --> 12:29:12,000
or a question mark question mark just to say if this doesn't have any value just

433
12:29:12,000 --> 12:29:15,440
use zero okay now that we have node count we have to

434
12:29:15,440 --> 12:29:18,872
get that context block

435
12:29:18,872 --> 12:29:23,112
and we oh we don't have log let's import that

436
12:29:23,112 --> 12:29:28,800
and remember the key that we used intel me and it's called notes title let's say

437
12:29:28,800 --> 12:29:33,440
notes title and now all of a sudden you can see it is a function that takes in

438
12:29:33,440 --> 12:29:38,160
an integer hello that's the count integer that we built into our arb and

439
12:29:38,160 --> 12:29:42,080
it returns a string you can see here that's perfect because then we can pass

440
12:29:42,080 --> 12:29:44,872
the note count in here okay

441
12:29:44,872 --> 12:29:49,440
and this will be our text

442
12:29:49,440 --> 12:29:52,560
and then we could just say return

443
12:29:52,560 --> 12:29:56,392
a text widget with that text in it just like this

444
12:29:56,392 --> 12:29:59,280
all right and then we can save this and as you can

445
12:29:59,280 --> 12:30:03,360
see now as soon as i hit command s it says no notes yet

446
12:30:03,360 --> 12:30:07,840
if i say and if i press the plus button here you can see i can type something in

447
12:30:07,840 --> 12:30:12,080
here and i go back it says onenote if i create another one

448
12:30:12,080 --> 12:30:16,000
on top of the screen it says two notes and that's it pretty much that's the

449
12:30:16,000 --> 12:30:19,592
logic that we built into it so now it says onenote delete that note and it

450
12:30:19,592 --> 12:30:24,312
says no notes yet perfect so that logic seems to be working fine for us

451
12:30:24,312 --> 12:30:27,920
so that's that part and we also have another string at the bottom of this

452
12:30:27,920 --> 12:30:33,512
screen which says log out and we have to change this as well so

453
12:30:33,512 --> 12:30:39,360
we have to say context log out button

454
12:30:39,360 --> 12:30:44,640
and this error is because we it says invalid constant but you're like oh but

455
12:30:44,640 --> 12:30:48,800
this is not a constant well the problem is a little bit higher up in that when

456
12:30:48,800 --> 12:30:52,080
we created this array of pop-up menu items we said that is a constant so

457
12:30:52,080 --> 12:30:57,752
let's remove that okay so that's fantastic and that is i mean

458
12:30:57,752 --> 12:31:01,360
now we're pretty much done in the entire application we don't have

459
12:31:01,360 --> 12:31:05,440
anything any string that is hard coded and if you look at our problems

460
12:31:05,440 --> 12:31:09,512
section there are no problems to fix for instance no unused imports so we've

461
12:31:09,512 --> 12:31:13,280
taken care of those as well and just to test this what we could do is just to go

462
12:31:13,280 --> 12:31:16,640
to the settings screen here and i'm going to bring swedish up

463
12:31:16,640 --> 12:31:20,312
and let's go back to our application here and have a look and it says no

464
12:31:20,312 --> 12:31:24,000
notes yet i'm going to press the plus button and i'm going to write some

465
12:31:24,000 --> 12:31:27,200
string go back here it says one note

466
12:31:27,200 --> 12:31:33,032
create a new one and it says two notes delete this one and all the you see all

467
12:31:33,032 --> 12:31:37,280
the dialogues are now in swedish yes delete this note

468
12:31:37,280 --> 12:31:41,360
yes let's try to log out now and it says log look at it

469
12:31:41,360 --> 12:31:44,312
and it says look go to add a second by the way look at it are you sure you want

470
12:31:44,312 --> 12:31:49,200
to log out yes log out and you can see all our strings here basically are also

471
12:31:49,200 --> 12:31:52,000
um everything in this screen is also

472
12:31:52,000 --> 12:31:57,360
localized so that's fantastic we basically did what we

473
12:31:57,360 --> 12:32:02,392
were supposed to do and what we promised to do and that is great congratulations

474
12:32:02,392 --> 12:32:06,080
if you then and do what we usually do at the end of every chapter we

475
12:32:06,080 --> 12:32:10,160
commit our work so i'm gonna have a look at this and let's have a look at our

476
12:32:10,160 --> 12:32:13,440
good status and have a look at our git log as well

477
12:32:13,440 --> 12:32:17,032
i'm gonna change the screen layout a little bit sorry about that so you see

478
12:32:17,032 --> 12:32:22,872
the code better remove scr cpy make this full screen

479
12:32:22,872 --> 12:32:28,080
okay i'm gonna make this a lot larger so you see better

480
12:32:28,080 --> 12:32:32,800
and have a look at git log again and you can see the last one we did git step

481
12:32:32,800 --> 12:32:38,080
sorry step 31 so let's just say git add

482
12:32:38,080 --> 12:32:42,080
all hit commits that 32

483
12:32:42,080 --> 12:32:45,280
okay and get status

484
12:32:45,280 --> 12:32:49,752
great and then we're also going to get push our changes

485
12:32:49,752 --> 12:32:55,200
and let's tag it as well get tagged step 32

486
12:32:55,200 --> 12:33:01,112
and if you look at our tag all our tags we can see 20 blah blah

487
12:33:01,112 --> 12:33:06,080
let's see if we have 31 30 31 and 32 great and then we have to push our tags

488
12:33:06,080 --> 12:33:10,392
as well fantastic so

489
12:33:10,392 --> 12:33:13,672
um what we've done so far is i mean we've

490
12:33:13,672 --> 12:33:17,440
done a lot of work and in this chapter even more we've localized our

491
12:33:17,440 --> 12:33:20,160
application we looked at how localization works how code generation

492
12:33:20,160 --> 12:33:23,200
for localization works and also we had a look at some

493
12:33:23,200 --> 12:33:26,560
important extensions that you can create in order to make your localizations even

494
12:33:26,560 --> 12:33:32,232
work better for flutter and we also had a look at adding some logic to our arb

495
12:33:32,232 --> 12:33:36,312
file with pluralization so congratulations for going through this

496
12:33:36,312 --> 12:33:38,560
chapter i believe personally that is very important to localize your

497
12:33:38,560 --> 12:33:42,160
applications you're going to reach a lot more users if you localize your

498
12:33:42,160 --> 12:33:47,200
applications correctly for your for like your target markets

499
12:33:47,200 --> 12:33:51,280
and um it should help your users also feel more connected to your application

500
12:33:51,280 --> 12:33:55,280
so um with that said i may actually then

501
12:33:55,280 --> 12:34:00,640
see you in the next chapter hello everyone i can't say welcome to

502
12:34:00,640 --> 12:34:04,560
this chapter now because this is not really a chapter on its own rather it is

503
12:34:04,560 --> 12:34:08,952
the outro to this course and i don't know it's a kind of a bittersweet moment

504
12:34:08,952 --> 12:34:13,672
because uh i've had so much fun putting this course together for you and now i

505
12:34:13,672 --> 12:34:16,560
have to say goodbye and um

506
12:34:16,560 --> 12:34:22,232
i don't want to get emotional but it is kind of sad uh as it is a great moment

507
12:34:22,232 --> 12:34:25,112
of appreciation for you having gone through

508
12:34:25,112 --> 12:34:29,512
this course and also i want to really extend like

509
12:34:29,512 --> 12:34:32,560
and congratulate you for having gone through

510
12:34:32,560 --> 12:34:37,592
this course and having learned as as you've learned because it's it's not

511
12:34:37,592 --> 12:34:42,392
an easy thing to do to go through such a lengthy course but as i mentioned in the

512
12:34:42,392 --> 12:34:46,080
beginning of this um course if you remember in the

513
12:34:46,080 --> 12:34:51,440
introduction i mentioned that um a lot of videos basically jump over

514
12:34:51,440 --> 12:34:54,872
quite a lot of information and i didn't want to do that in this course and

515
12:34:54,872 --> 12:34:58,720
that's why this course has become as

516
12:34:58,720 --> 12:35:03,112
lengthy and long as it has so

517
12:35:03,112 --> 12:35:07,200
we've gone through a lot we've talked not only about

518
12:35:07,200 --> 12:35:11,592
flutter development but we've also got our hands dirty with some

519
12:35:11,592 --> 12:35:15,440
native ios and not really development but all actually going to xcode and

520
12:35:15,440 --> 12:35:19,840
fiddling around with some properties in info plus an excel project we've also

521
12:35:19,840 --> 12:35:26,232
had to open android studio to create our virtual devices we've worked with

522
12:35:26,232 --> 12:35:31,512
figma and design tool we work with app store connect and google play store

523
12:35:31,512 --> 12:35:36,312
console so we've gone through a lot so and i want

524
12:35:36,312 --> 12:35:41,360
to congratulate you for sticking throughout all this with me and

525
12:35:41,360 --> 12:35:47,592
um hopefully you've also learned a lot now while designing this course i also

526
12:35:47,592 --> 12:35:51,440
knew that it has to be a living material it can't just be something that i drop

527
12:35:51,440 --> 12:35:55,672
out on the internet so i'm very much planning to keep everything up to date

528
12:35:55,672 --> 12:36:00,000
but there's lots and lots that i've already planned

529
12:36:00,000 --> 12:36:04,560
more to be added to this course so i can't really go into details about

530
12:36:04,560 --> 12:36:08,160
what they are i haven't finalized them but just as i did with this course i

531
12:36:08,160 --> 12:36:12,080
need to plan them correctly write all my scripts to know what i'm going to talk

532
12:36:12,080 --> 12:36:17,360
about and plan even the code that i need to write to tell you all about so

533
12:36:17,360 --> 12:36:21,200
just know that there's a lot more to come

534
12:36:21,200 --> 12:36:24,160
and you can just subscribe to my youtube

535
12:36:24,160 --> 12:36:29,592
channel if you want to keep up to date talking about up to date um

536
12:36:29,592 --> 12:36:33,440
things are moving all the time we've been working with firebase for instance

537
12:36:33,440 --> 12:36:38,872
and firebase in itself is a moving product so it's an update like ever

538
12:36:38,872 --> 12:36:42,720
it's just always updating so new versions come out new versions of

539
12:36:42,720 --> 12:36:46,800
flutter might come up come out and new versions of dart might come out so even

540
12:36:46,800 --> 12:36:49,920
figma for instance that we've been using a lot the interface might change

541
12:36:49,920 --> 12:36:53,920
erratically so since i put so much effort into creating

542
12:36:53,920 --> 12:36:58,232
this course i don't want it to die and i'm not going to let it die so it's

543
12:36:58,232 --> 12:37:02,000
always going to be updating every now and then i will be putting

544
12:37:02,000 --> 12:37:06,488
and not only updated content out like maybe i need to replace some old content

545
12:37:06,488 --> 12:37:11,200
with some new but i'm also planning on adding more to it so

546
12:37:11,200 --> 12:37:16,720
let's just say that this course is gonna hopefully always be up to date

547
12:37:16,720 --> 12:37:21,032
as i mentioned in the introduction of this course i have zero dollars

548
12:37:21,032 --> 12:37:25,752
in a budget for marketing this course and marketing is

549
12:37:25,752 --> 12:37:30,488
probably the wrong word because i don't actually earn any money by having this

550
12:37:30,488 --> 12:37:33,200
course the only thing i earn is joy of having

551
12:37:33,200 --> 12:37:37,592
um like people like you going through this course and telling me on social

552
12:37:37,592 --> 12:37:41,032
media perhaps about oh hey i did this course and i learned this and this and

553
12:37:41,032 --> 12:37:43,440
this and i've released my first application so

554
12:37:43,440 --> 12:37:47,592
since i have um no budget for that i would really appreciate it if you could

555
12:37:47,592 --> 12:37:51,440
spread the word about it and tell like if someone asked okay i need a course

556
12:37:51,440 --> 12:37:55,112
for learning flutter uh it would be lovely and i would really

557
12:37:55,112 --> 12:37:59,032
appreciate it if you could just tell them about this course

558
12:37:59,032 --> 12:38:02,952
and um i've mentioned this also in the introduction but i would really

559
12:38:02,952 --> 12:38:08,952
appreciate it if you could follow me on social media twitter at van.np and also

560
12:38:08,952 --> 12:38:12,232
on linkedin because i produce quite a lot of content

561
12:38:12,232 --> 12:38:16,488
and as infographics for instance also adds videos related to flutter

562
12:38:16,488 --> 12:38:22,952
javascript python django react native swift you name it so even typescript now

563
12:38:22,952 --> 12:38:25,840
these days so uh i would really appreciate it if you

564
12:38:25,840 --> 12:38:31,360
could follow me on social media and uh i've been told in some places

565
12:38:31,360 --> 12:38:36,720
that um by some some of you that maybe some people can actually support

566
12:38:36,720 --> 12:38:40,640
me and if you want to do that this is the way to do it just going to

567
12:38:40,640 --> 12:38:45,512
buy me a coffee.com but remember it is completely

568
12:38:45,512 --> 12:38:51,752
optional it's only if you can afford it so with all that said i don't want to

569
12:38:51,752 --> 12:38:57,200
drag on this outro i just want to say again a huge congratulations to you for

570
12:38:57,200 --> 12:39:02,872
going through this course with me and spending your life during these so many

571
12:39:02,872 --> 12:39:08,640
hours together with me and i've had a blast recording all these videos and uh

572
12:39:08,640 --> 12:39:14,312
i'm sure this is not a good buy but rather an official end basically to this

573
12:39:14,312 --> 12:39:19,280
course and keep an eye out for more content and i'm sure we'll talk to each

574
12:39:19,280 --> 12:39:23,232
other on social media
