1
07:06:03,840 --> 07:06:07,360
scrcpy together actually as we're going to do

2
07:06:07,360 --> 07:06:10,080
in this course so

3
07:06:10,080 --> 07:06:14,000
i'm just going to take in my notes here that i've explained that so

4
07:06:14,000 --> 07:06:20,400
um before actually we go about installing scrcpy we need to

5
07:06:20,400 --> 07:06:26,000
do um we need to install adb and

6
07:06:26,000 --> 07:06:31,680
this adb is like um i believe it actually stands for android

7
07:06:31,680 --> 07:06:36,400
debugger or something let's see what actually adb stands for

8
07:06:36,400 --> 07:06:42,400
i'm gonna bring up a um a safari window here as you can see adb

9
07:06:42,400 --> 07:06:47,760
stands for android debug bridge and adb is a great tool if you want to for

10
07:06:47,760 --> 07:06:52,240
instance be able to talk with your android telephone all from the command

11
07:06:52,240 --> 07:06:56,878
line so you can send it a message and say hey take a screenshot

12
07:06:56,878 --> 07:07:02,798
hey do this or click here or yet close this application whatever so you

13
07:07:02,798 --> 07:07:06,240
basically send commands to your android telephone or tablet through your

14
07:07:06,240 --> 07:07:09,520
terminal it's um it's fantastic and

15
07:07:09,520 --> 07:07:11,680
with with

16
07:07:11,680 --> 07:07:16,638
adb i mean having adb install your computer then you can actually install

17
07:07:16,638 --> 07:07:21,200
scrcpy which uses adb in order to talk to your

18
07:07:21,200 --> 07:07:26,638
telephone and send commands to it and receive images from it etc so

19
07:07:26,638 --> 07:07:32,558
with that said we need to install adb so i'm going to close this turn window here

20
07:07:32,558 --> 07:07:38,240
and i'm going to bring up terminal i'm going to increase the size of this

21
07:07:38,240 --> 07:07:41,360
terminal window so you see what i'm doing okay

22
07:07:41,360 --> 07:07:46,240
so in here then i'm going to say brew install

23
07:07:46,240 --> 07:07:51,760
cask android platform tools okay

24
07:07:51,760 --> 07:07:58,240
so this will then allow you to install if i can

25
07:07:58,240 --> 07:08:03,600
using android platform tools then um you will be able to grab adb from that so

26
07:08:03,600 --> 07:08:07,600
android platform tools insta installation actually includes adb all

27
07:08:07,600 --> 07:08:09,600
right so

28
07:08:09,600 --> 07:08:13,440
um i can see that i mean for me you can see that i've already installed android

29
07:08:13,440 --> 07:08:17,120
platform tools so i get this message here saying that well you've already

30
07:08:17,120 --> 07:08:20,478
installed it but if you have not installed android

31
07:08:20,478 --> 07:08:24,478
platform tools before you will running this command will actually install it

32
07:08:24,478 --> 07:08:28,400
for you now i don't want to reinstall it so i'm just not going to do this

33
07:08:28,400 --> 07:08:33,520
suggested command here but just know that before you install scr cpy you will

34
07:08:33,520 --> 07:08:42,558
need to get adb up and running okay and that comes in android platform tools

35
07:08:42,558 --> 07:08:45,680
all right

36
07:08:45,680 --> 07:08:49,360
so let's let me just go into my notes and

37
07:08:49,360 --> 07:08:55,600
say that we've talked about adb so after you've done adb we need to go and i'm

38
07:08:55,600 --> 07:09:00,958
going to bring up safari again let's see if i can bring up the window

39
07:09:00,958 --> 07:09:06,000
here so you can see what i'm doing as well then i'm going to say scr cpy

40
07:09:06,000 --> 07:09:09,840
okay and then you will see that the first suggested website is on github and

41
07:09:09,840 --> 07:09:15,840
this is exactly where you need to go so go to scrcpy here and you will see

42
07:09:15,840 --> 07:09:21,200
information about how you can actually install scrcpy and it says on linux you

43
07:09:21,200 --> 07:09:26,320
can do apt installer crcpy on windows you can do a download here

44
07:09:26,320 --> 07:09:30,080
and on mac os then you can do brew install

45
07:09:30,080 --> 07:09:33,280
scr cpy

46
07:09:33,280 --> 07:09:36,160
so i've already done that so i've already

47
07:09:36,160 --> 07:09:42,478
actually installed scrcpy so i don't have to do anything special

48
07:09:42,478 --> 07:09:46,878
and um you can see it actually tells you here i'm going to increase the size of

49
07:09:46,878 --> 07:09:49,440
this window so you can see a little bit better

50
07:09:49,440 --> 07:09:53,920
and it will tell you here that you need adb accessible from your path if you

51
07:09:53,920 --> 07:09:59,200
don't have it yet then do that command that i mentioned to you okay

52
07:09:59,200 --> 07:10:02,400
so after you've done the installation on

53
07:10:02,400 --> 07:10:06,000
your computer then you should be able to bring up a terminal so i'm going to

54
07:10:06,000 --> 07:10:08,718
bring up terminal here and

55
07:10:08,718 --> 07:10:14,080
as you can see here i have my android telephone and it the screen looks like

56
07:10:14,080 --> 07:10:20,798
this right now so it's just on the home screen nothing special

57
07:10:20,798 --> 07:10:25,840
then i want to bring up scrcpy

58
07:10:25,840 --> 07:10:29,120
but before you do that if this is the first time you're doing

59
07:10:29,120 --> 07:10:34,478
this process you will probably need to enable something called usb debugging on

60
07:10:34,478 --> 07:10:37,680
your android telephone and

61
07:10:37,680 --> 07:10:43,280
depending on how your what your android phone looks like or

62
07:10:43,280 --> 07:10:46,638
what it is the usb debugging when you plug your

63
07:10:46,638 --> 07:10:49,520
android telephone it will kind of show you

64
07:10:49,520 --> 07:10:52,558
um a screen like this

65
07:10:52,558 --> 07:10:55,520
so i'm going to enlarge this a little bit so you can see better

66
07:10:55,520 --> 07:11:01,040
so this dialog will pop up on your android telephone saying that oh do you

67
07:11:01,040 --> 07:11:05,600
want to allow this computer to do debugging on this um on this telephone

68
07:11:05,600 --> 07:11:08,878
and what you need to do is just to say always allow from this computer and then

69
07:11:08,878 --> 07:11:15,840
press the ok button this is only so that you will be first of all able to install

70
07:11:15,840 --> 07:11:19,280
and debug your flutter applications

71
07:11:19,280 --> 07:11:23,120
all from visual studio code or from android studio right on your android

72
07:11:23,120 --> 07:11:27,520
telephone or tablet and also it will allow you to run scrcpy

73
07:11:27,520 --> 07:11:32,240
which in turn uses adb in order in order to communicate with

74
07:11:32,240 --> 07:11:36,878
your device okay so

75
07:11:36,878 --> 07:11:43,120
that is for usb debugging all right

76
07:11:43,120 --> 07:11:46,798
so what we need to do is actually bring up scr cpy so

77
07:11:46,798 --> 07:11:50,478
in terminal i'm just going to say ser cpy

78
07:11:50,478 --> 07:11:53,440
and as you can see here it's going to talk to my android telephone and it

79
07:11:53,440 --> 07:11:57,600
brought up a window which i'm going to slowly bring here to this screen so you

80
07:11:57,600 --> 07:12:00,718
can see so

81
07:12:00,718 --> 07:12:03,760
i'm going to leave the terminal here because the terminal is actually fueling

82
07:12:03,760 --> 07:12:07,760
this thing so if i close my terminal this is also going to be closed so just

83
07:12:07,760 --> 07:12:12,798
keep this terminal open or if you're using item for instance like i'm using

84
07:12:12,798 --> 07:12:16,400
then you can bring up a new tab and continue working with another

85
07:12:16,400 --> 07:12:20,558
command line otherwise you can just close it or you can just minimize this

86
07:12:20,558 --> 07:12:25,840
if you're if you're bothered by it so as you can see now i have my android

87
07:12:25,840 --> 07:12:28,718
phone here mirrored on my screen i'm actually going

88
07:12:28,718 --> 07:12:32,400
to do this so you can see it a little bit better i'm going to bring it right

89
07:12:32,400 --> 07:12:38,558
here in between so this is my actual android phone so if i click here with my

90
07:12:38,558 --> 07:12:42,638
mouse it actually interacts with my phone so

91
07:12:42,638 --> 07:12:47,600
i can bring up my phone here so you kind of see them side by side

92
07:12:47,600 --> 07:12:52,478
and if on the if on the scrcpy screen here i press the

93
07:12:52,478 --> 07:12:56,000
back button you will see that my android screen

94
07:12:56,000 --> 07:13:00,000
changes one more time click on google

95
07:13:00,000 --> 07:13:04,638
so it's really interacting with my android telephone here okay

96
07:13:04,638 --> 07:13:06,878
so i highly suggest that you actually

97
07:13:06,878 --> 07:13:11,200
install sdrcpy to be honest with you it's a great great tool if you're into

98
07:13:11,200 --> 07:13:15,360
mobile development or if you want to become a mobile developer so

99
07:13:15,360 --> 07:13:18,958
um and regarding what i said earlier about

100
07:13:18,958 --> 07:13:23,840
devices i think in you will get really really far with the

101
07:13:23,840 --> 07:13:28,638
ios simulator and the android emulator however

102
07:13:28,638 --> 07:13:31,360
i personally should suggest that you spend

103
07:13:31,360 --> 07:13:35,680
and invest some money into getting devices for for yourself they don't have

104
07:13:35,680 --> 07:13:39,040
to be top of the line latest devices but

105
07:13:39,040 --> 07:13:42,798
one android telephone and one ios telephone

106
07:13:42,798 --> 07:13:46,558
or even tablets will do but preferably telephones you don't even have to have

107
07:13:46,558 --> 07:13:51,440
sim cards in them just just the telephone device physically itself so

108
07:13:51,440 --> 07:13:53,520
um and

109
07:13:53,520 --> 07:13:57,360
i mean if you're getting into mobile development you will kind of after many

110
07:13:57,360 --> 07:14:01,760
years kind of have a lot of telephones anyways because you will get like this

111
07:14:01,760 --> 07:14:05,280
year's new telephone and then two years later you get another telephone so you

112
07:14:05,280 --> 07:14:07,760
kind of pile them up um

113
07:14:07,760 --> 07:14:12,718
and you could use those all telephones then as test telephones as we call them

114
07:14:12,718 --> 07:14:15,280
all right so

115
07:14:15,280 --> 07:14:20,878
that's that part now what we need to do next is to now that our android phone is

116
07:14:20,878 --> 07:14:24,718
connected here what we need to do is to go to visual

117
07:14:24,718 --> 07:14:30,638
studio code into our project and choose that um

118
07:14:30,638 --> 07:14:35,200
so choose our let me see bring up visual studio code here if i can visual studio

119
07:14:35,200 --> 07:14:38,638
code this is i have so many screens here so

120
07:14:38,638 --> 07:14:41,200
it's a little bit of a challenge to actually

121
07:14:41,200 --> 07:14:45,680
line them up all here so what i'll do here is i will get rid of the side

122
07:14:45,680 --> 07:14:50,878
window all right and i will bring up then scr cpy on the right hand side and

123
07:14:50,878 --> 07:14:54,718
then just resize the screen a little bit here

124
07:14:54,718 --> 07:14:59,040
and then like this so i have you this is like my usual setup so i have visual

125
07:14:59,040 --> 07:15:03,600
studio code here on the left and then i have my android phone mirrored on the

126
07:15:03,600 --> 07:15:08,000
right hand side okay so what then you'll need to do after

127
07:15:08,000 --> 07:15:11,520
you've done all of this work is in visual studio code just say command

128
07:15:11,520 --> 07:15:17,200
shift p on mac or ctrl shift b on linux and

129
07:15:17,200 --> 07:15:20,400
windows and if you're using android studio i don't to honestly know the

130
07:15:20,400 --> 07:15:24,320
commands there to select a device in flutter they may be like a drop down or

131
07:15:24,320 --> 07:15:28,320
something so please do that so here i'm just going to say command

132
07:15:28,320 --> 07:15:31,600
shift b and i'm going to say flutter select device okay

133
07:15:31,600 --> 07:15:34,638
and in select device i'm actually going to choose my

134
07:15:34,638 --> 07:15:38,240
android telephone which is the one being mirrored here

135
07:15:38,240 --> 07:15:42,160
choose an android phone and then i'm going to say run run without debugging

136
07:15:42,160 --> 07:15:45,360
okay

137
07:15:45,360 --> 07:15:49,280
so let's then see

138
07:15:49,280 --> 07:15:56,400
that you can see here it says launching dart on gm 19 blah blah in debug mode so

139
07:15:56,400 --> 07:16:00,240
since it's an android application now all of a sudden we just switch from ios

140
07:16:00,240 --> 07:16:03,520
to android previously our application was being like our source code was being

141
07:16:03,520 --> 07:16:07,840
compiled by xcode and now since we're trying to deploy to

142
07:16:07,840 --> 07:16:11,680
an android telephone it's the gradle it's gradle basically that's taking care

143
07:16:11,680 --> 07:16:15,520
of the build process so if you're an android developer then you know that

144
07:16:15,520 --> 07:16:18,558
basically gradle zero build system and yeah

145
07:16:18,558 --> 07:16:22,240
it is working um it is basically doing the build in the

146
07:16:22,240 --> 07:16:26,638
background so i'm actually so glad that we got this

147
07:16:26,638 --> 07:16:31,120
error right now so i'm gonna take here in my notes that we've talked about in

148
07:16:31,120 --> 07:16:36,000
vs code select android and then show android phone mirroring working okay

149
07:16:36,000 --> 07:16:40,478
so you see here we got some errors

150
07:16:40,478 --> 07:16:44,240
actually when we talked about in chapter what chapter are we on we're on chapter

151
07:16:44,240 --> 07:16:48,798
10. in chapter 9 when we talked about running our application on ios we

152
07:16:48,798 --> 07:16:53,520
actually got something similar there was an error saying that oh your

153
07:16:53,520 --> 07:16:57,200
uh dependencies firebase they need this

154
07:16:57,200 --> 07:17:00,958
version but you're on that version and and the under

155
07:17:00,958 --> 07:17:04,718
and the code that actually solved it if you remember we went to our pod file i

156
07:17:04,718 --> 07:17:09,840
just put this platform here saying ios 13 because you see we have four

157
07:17:09,840 --> 07:17:14,718
dependencies at the moment we have firebase auth we have firebase core

158
07:17:14,718 --> 07:17:18,798
analytics and something else which i don't remember let me have a look at the

159
07:17:18,798 --> 07:17:23,120
notes here there were core auth cloud firestore and

160
07:17:23,120 --> 07:17:27,440
firebase analytics these four dependencies they have their

161
07:17:27,440 --> 07:17:32,958
own requirements so they say that we as dependencies cannot be installed on an

162
07:17:32,958 --> 07:17:38,718
application that for instance supports a very old android os or a very old ios

163
07:17:38,718 --> 07:17:44,958
version so these dependencies are putting requirements on your project so

164
07:17:44,958 --> 07:17:52,000
and we fixed that yes uh in the in chapter nine we fixed that um by going

165
07:17:52,000 --> 07:17:56,160
into the pod file and commenting out this basically removing

166
07:17:56,160 --> 07:17:59,920
the comment from this line and changing it from 9

167
07:17:59,920 --> 07:18:05,600
to 13. so we fix it like that for ios but how do we do it for android now we

168
07:18:05,600 --> 07:18:09,360
get a lot of great information here and it says that you kind of need to find

169
07:18:09,360 --> 07:18:15,680
this debug default config and min sdk version okay so let's look for default

170
07:18:15,680 --> 07:18:22,000
config so i'm going to copy that text and i'm going to then command shift f in

171
07:18:22,000 --> 07:18:28,240
visual studio code and search for it and as you can see here we have a little um

172
07:18:28,240 --> 07:18:31,760
flutter version name and then flutter version code to integer

173
07:18:31,760 --> 07:18:36,638
and i can see here there is information about flutter versions like

174
07:18:36,638 --> 07:18:39,920
if you go to our build gradle and

175
07:18:39,920 --> 07:18:44,638
there is a flutter version code to integer that is the

176
07:18:44,638 --> 07:18:49,600
and the where's the main sdk here min sdk version okay so i'm going to search

177
07:18:49,600 --> 07:18:54,558
for min sdk version and here i can see it is 19 here it is

178
07:18:54,558 --> 07:19:01,120
19. and android min sdk version 19 so there's actually quite a lot of

179
07:19:01,120 --> 07:19:05,120
places where 19 is mentioned all right

180
07:19:05,120 --> 07:19:11,520
and the error itself let's read it requires a higher android sdk version

181
07:19:11,520 --> 07:19:16,958
fix this by adding the following to the file build gradle android default config

182
07:19:16,958 --> 07:19:23,200
min sdk version okay so if we look at the default config here

183
07:19:23,200 --> 07:19:27,200
it's talking about this thing min sdk version i can see that previously this

184
07:19:27,200 --> 07:19:31,680
used to be a number and recently it has been changed to flutter min sdk version

185
07:19:31,680 --> 07:19:36,398
so i'm going to bring up a safari window and i'm going to say change flutter min

186
07:19:36,398 --> 07:19:41,520
sdk version so let's see what people are actually suggesting is there a good

187
07:19:41,520 --> 07:19:46,878
command that allows us to do this you see people are still saying that we

188
07:19:46,878 --> 07:19:52,080
need to do it like that by changing it to a specific version but i believe

189
07:19:52,080 --> 07:19:57,120
there should be a better way of doing this instead of hard-coding it um

190
07:19:57,120 --> 07:20:00,240
with the new flutter project with the flutter style you're unable to change

191
07:20:00,240 --> 07:20:03,760
the mini sdk version and local properties

192
07:20:03,760 --> 07:20:08,080
great okay so if we go to a file called local.properties that's what they're

193
07:20:08,080 --> 07:20:10,718
saying here so i'm gonna

194
07:20:10,718 --> 07:20:15,600
try to find local properties and i can see here

195
07:20:15,600 --> 07:20:21,680
there is an sdk set here but there is no min sdk version

196
07:20:21,680 --> 07:20:25,040
so we probably need to just go and fix that

197
07:20:25,040 --> 07:20:28,638
up so i'm going to copy paste and i'm just going to say flutter.sdk version

198
07:20:28,638 --> 07:20:34,160
19. okay save that file then i'm going to go back to the main dart and then say

199
07:20:34,160 --> 07:20:39,440
run without debugging let's see what happens this time

200
07:20:39,440 --> 07:20:43,040
and if it accepts that local properties change that we just

201
07:20:43,040 --> 07:20:46,718
made and it's still saying that it won't be

202
07:20:46,718 --> 07:20:50,718
able to users running so uh what we could do in here to be honest

203
07:20:50,718 --> 07:20:54,638
with you is just troubleshooting so let's just say go back to the root

204
07:20:54,638 --> 07:21:02,160
folder of your application and say flutter clean android

205
07:21:02,160 --> 07:21:06,320
why is it doing the xcode workspace and then say flutter

206
07:21:06,320 --> 07:21:13,120
pop get

207
07:21:13,120 --> 07:21:17,600
so if this works properly then it should have cleaned the android code for us and

208
07:21:17,600 --> 07:21:22,320
like put the version 19 in our build gradle like this should actually resolve

209
07:21:22,320 --> 07:21:27,280
to 19 so let's go to main dart and just give it one more try if this if this

210
07:21:27,280 --> 07:21:30,718
solution doesn't work then we unfortunately have to go into our

211
07:21:30,718 --> 07:21:34,878
build gradle file and and do what was recommended and put the min sdk version

212
07:21:34,878 --> 07:21:38,558
there as a constant value of 19 just to get the code

213
07:21:38,558 --> 07:21:42,958
compiling so let's have a look here at um

214
07:21:42,958 --> 07:21:47,680
what our gradle build is gonna do

215
07:21:47,680 --> 07:21:50,240
so i don't really know what happened with

216
07:21:50,240 --> 07:21:53,840
it

217
07:21:53,840 --> 07:21:58,398
i it doesn't seem to really be doing anything so one more try run without

218
07:21:58,398 --> 07:22:02,558
debugging and see what happens launching

219
07:22:02,558 --> 07:22:05,920
i'm gonna have a look at my android phone here as well running gradle task

220
07:22:05,920 --> 07:22:10,638
assemble debug

221
07:22:10,638 --> 07:22:14,718
and for me it's not running anything at the moment on this on this phone so what

222
07:22:14,718 --> 07:22:19,040
we're gonna do is let's go to i mean this solution didn't work so

223
07:22:19,040 --> 07:22:23,440
i'm gonna remove that and i'm gonna go to build gradle and put the

224
07:22:23,440 --> 07:22:28,798
target sdk version i think that was the min sdk version sorry

225
07:22:28,798 --> 07:22:33,200
and here we're just gonna say 19 instead okay

226
07:22:33,200 --> 07:22:36,638
like that like it was actually suggested to us so

227
07:22:36,638 --> 07:22:40,718
um let's then go to main dart and then say run without debugging one more time

228
07:22:40,718 --> 07:22:45,120
and if this solution doesn't work i may actually have to like restart the visual

229
07:22:45,120 --> 07:22:48,638
studio code if it's kind of confused for some reason

230
07:22:48,638 --> 07:22:52,878
because usually when you say gradle like when you start the build

231
07:22:52,878 --> 07:22:57,680
process it actually gives you some feedback it either says that something

232
07:22:57,680 --> 07:23:03,920
failed or that yeah i um it then ran successfully and in this

233
07:23:03,920 --> 07:23:07,200
case i can see it's not running so i'm just gonna say quit visual studio code

234
07:23:07,200 --> 07:23:10,160
okay and then i'm gonna bring up visual

235
07:23:10,160 --> 07:23:13,440
studio code so i have a lot of projects usually so

236
07:23:13,440 --> 07:23:16,398
i'm gonna [Music]

237
07:23:16,398 --> 07:23:20,558
minimize all of these things and i'm going to only open

238
07:23:20,558 --> 07:23:25,280
our my notes application so let's go in there

239
07:23:25,280 --> 07:23:29,920
to our my notes application and let's give this a try one more time i'm going

240
07:23:29,920 --> 07:23:35,040
to go to run without debugging and let's see what happens

241
07:23:35,040 --> 07:23:39,280
oh now it's choosing iphone 13 pro in debug mode so that's because i restarted

242
07:23:39,280 --> 07:23:42,558
visual studio code and it doesn't know which device to run on so i'm going to

243
07:23:42,558 --> 07:23:46,160
say select device and then choose my android phone again

244
07:23:46,160 --> 07:23:52,080
run run without debugging and hopefully crossing my fingers here

245
07:23:52,080 --> 07:23:55,120
that since we've changed the

246
07:23:55,120 --> 07:23:58,160
um version number then it's going to work

247
07:23:58,160 --> 07:24:02,478
and i can see here

248
07:24:02,478 --> 07:24:07,600
i see so now it's com complaining about multi-decks so i mean this is great

249
07:24:07,600 --> 07:24:11,280
stuff i'm so glad that we're seeing all these errors because usually we don't

250
07:24:11,280 --> 07:24:14,798
have the possible i mean usually you see in tutorials that yeah everything's

251
07:24:14,798 --> 07:24:19,120
working fine uh he clicked there and clicked there and everything worked but

252
07:24:19,120 --> 07:24:23,600
here we're actually getting to the point where you see every issue that could

253
07:24:23,600 --> 07:24:26,798
arise and then we're gonna fix it together and this is like a day in the

254
07:24:26,798 --> 07:24:31,760
life of a software developer things go wrong but then you'll have to fix it so

255
07:24:31,760 --> 07:24:35,520
um this multi-dex is something that you'll have to

256
07:24:35,520 --> 07:24:42,478
configure and we're going to say use multi-dex flag so

257
07:24:42,478 --> 07:24:46,798
i'm going to go to safari and i'm going to paste it here

258
07:24:46,798 --> 07:24:50,958
um and then there is a solution hopefully somewhere in our default

259
07:24:50,958 --> 07:24:54,478
config you see it says multi-dex enabled so

260
07:24:54,478 --> 07:24:59,760
let's go to your to the build gradle in app which is right here

261
07:24:59,760 --> 07:25:04,558
you see android app build gradle in your default config as it says here

262
07:25:04,558 --> 07:25:08,878
multi-decks enabled just bring it here it's it there

263
07:25:08,878 --> 07:25:13,520
and then go to your dependencies at the bottom of this file right here and bring

264
07:25:13,520 --> 07:25:18,398
implementation multi-decks right there okay so i'm just going to paste it right

265
07:25:18,398 --> 07:25:23,440
there go back to my main guard file here and then say run run without debugging

266
07:25:23,440 --> 07:25:28,000
so let's see what happens

267
07:25:28,000 --> 07:25:31,120
and there are some warnings here that are printed in red you don't have to

268
07:25:31,120 --> 07:25:34,878
worry about them so much right now there are warnings as their name

269
07:25:34,878 --> 07:25:39,360
suggests so um you don't have to worry so much to be honest with you as i

270
07:25:39,360 --> 07:25:44,478
mentioned so there we go here is um our flutter

271
07:25:44,478 --> 07:25:49,600
application now working and running on um

272
07:25:49,600 --> 07:25:55,120
on the actual phone so i'm gonna bring then the phone here

273
07:25:55,120 --> 07:25:59,440
and you can see it is showing the exact same thing so if i with my mouse go over

274
07:25:59,440 --> 07:26:03,040
you can't see that because you're actually seeing my face

275
07:26:03,040 --> 07:26:06,798
so um and then you will see the value 3

276
07:26:06,798 --> 07:26:10,878
printed here as well so that's that's great

277
07:26:10,878 --> 07:26:14,320
stuff um

278
07:26:14,320 --> 07:26:23,840
then

279
07:26:23,840 --> 07:26:28,798
i don't know why this uh screen is rotated

280
07:26:28,798 --> 07:26:32,398
i rotate it back oh it's because my phone is actually

281
07:26:32,398 --> 07:26:37,680
rotated so i'm gonna rotate it back so it's uh

282
07:26:37,680 --> 07:26:42,320
it's not rotated in the wrong orientation great so we got a lot of

283
07:26:42,320 --> 07:26:46,160
problems to be honest with you there um but that's okay that's usually what

284
07:26:46,160 --> 07:26:50,160
happens when we're working with mobile development at least in the beginning

285
07:26:50,160 --> 07:26:53,360
when you're doing the setup so i'm actually

286
07:26:53,360 --> 07:26:57,920
grateful that we're getting these errors so you see them so you don't just think

287
07:26:57,920 --> 07:27:01,440
everything is going to work from the absolute beginning so

288
07:27:01,440 --> 07:27:04,160
even though as i said in the introduction i haven't planned all of

289
07:27:04,160 --> 07:27:08,240
this that these errors come up i don't want things to be perfect so even though

290
07:27:08,240 --> 07:27:12,958
that is happening but i'm still quite grateful that they are happening so

291
07:27:12,958 --> 07:27:18,558
what we need to talk about now is something called screen sleeping and um

292
07:27:18,558 --> 07:27:23,680
as you're developing your uh application on your android telephone or tablet

293
07:27:23,680 --> 07:27:28,398
you'll notice that you will run your application on the phone or the tablet

294
07:27:28,398 --> 07:27:31,680
and then after after a short while your screen will go

295
07:27:31,680 --> 07:27:34,398
to sleep which means the screen will be locked

296
07:27:34,398 --> 07:27:38,558
and then when you try to then rerun or rerun your application or re refresh

297
07:27:38,558 --> 07:27:41,920
your application then you will get an error from flutter saying that it cannot

298
07:27:41,920 --> 07:27:45,280
deploy the application because the device is locked so

299
07:27:45,280 --> 07:27:48,638
that is quite annoying that the telephone does it but it is for a good

300
07:27:48,638 --> 07:27:52,320
reason the telephones like for security purposes they have to lock the screen so

301
07:27:52,320 --> 07:27:55,280
that if you leave it somewhere on a bench or something in a park and you

302
07:27:55,280 --> 07:27:59,040
just forget it and you go away then it is locked so no one's going to get

303
07:27:59,040 --> 07:28:03,760
access to your telephones data with that said what we need to do

304
07:28:03,760 --> 07:28:07,280
is disable it while you're developing your applications because

305
07:28:07,280 --> 07:28:10,638
what you want is a telephone that's always there is available the screen

306
07:28:10,638 --> 07:28:14,558
doesn't lock so you can always deploy a newer version of our application to it

307
07:28:14,558 --> 07:28:20,000
or as or as long as you you don't lock it yourself manually

308
07:28:20,000 --> 07:28:23,440
so what we're going to do is i'm going to bring up the phone here so you see

309
07:28:23,440 --> 07:28:28,840
what i'm doing i'm going to go here i'm going to go to the settings

310
07:28:28,840 --> 07:28:32,558
screen um here and

311
07:28:32,558 --> 07:28:35,920
you will probably need to i mean in order for you to actually even be able

312
07:28:35,920 --> 07:28:39,920
to run your application and do funky things with your application on your

313
07:28:39,920 --> 07:28:43,360
telephone you need to enable something called developer remote so developer

314
07:28:43,360 --> 07:28:48,000
mode on android and on ios is a series of development tools that the phone

315
07:28:48,000 --> 07:28:52,240
provides only to developers and in order to get those tools you need to perform a

316
07:28:52,240 --> 07:28:56,398
series of actions like a monkey or something on your telephone and

317
07:28:56,398 --> 07:29:00,320
um i'm not going to provide instructions exactly how to do that for all different

318
07:29:00,320 --> 07:29:03,200
phones because depending on the manufacturer of your telephone

319
07:29:03,200 --> 07:29:07,200
especially if it's on android then developer mode is brought

320
07:29:07,200 --> 07:29:11,040
into life in a different way so what you need to do is to find out the

321
07:29:11,040 --> 07:29:15,200
manufacturer of your telephone and the model of your telephone here is a

322
07:29:15,200 --> 07:29:20,718
oneplus pro 7 i believe and then google and say oneplus pro 7 developer options

323
07:29:20,718 --> 07:29:23,600
or developer mode then you'll get some information about

324
07:29:23,600 --> 07:29:28,000
how to enable that i've already done that so if i go to i believe it's

325
07:29:28,000 --> 07:29:31,440
utilities or sorry i think it's system then

326
07:29:31,440 --> 07:29:35,520
you can see there then i have an option called developer options okay

327
07:29:35,520 --> 07:29:39,760
so in order to disable screen sleeping you have to go to developer option and

328
07:29:39,760 --> 07:29:45,200
say stay awake and that is by default disabled all

329
07:29:45,200 --> 07:29:47,680
right

330
07:29:47,680 --> 07:29:50,718
so um

331
07:29:50,718 --> 07:29:56,718
we've now then talked about um developer tools and we've talked about

332
07:29:56,718 --> 07:30:02,320
that you can interact with your telephone uh using scrcpy so

333
07:30:02,320 --> 07:30:06,840
to be honest with you i think i think that's all you need to know for

334
07:30:06,840 --> 07:30:12,398
um for the android setup there is not much more to talk about the rest is just

335
07:30:12,398 --> 07:30:17,600
developing our application as usual and then running it on the android phone and

336
07:30:17,600 --> 07:30:21,680
then mirroring the screen using a crcpy so that's what i'm going to do for the

337
07:30:21,680 --> 07:30:26,000
entirety of this course i'm going to primarily run the application run our

338
07:30:26,000 --> 07:30:29,680
application that we're going to develop in this course on this telephone and

339
07:30:29,680 --> 07:30:33,920
mirror the screen using scr cpy but you may choose to use an ios

340
07:30:33,920 --> 07:30:38,718
simulator or an android emulator or an ios phone or a tablet whatever

341
07:30:38,718 --> 07:30:42,320
so i can't provide descriptions about how to do all of

342
07:30:42,320 --> 07:30:46,398
those things because that is a complete course of its own but at least now you

343
07:30:46,398 --> 07:30:50,878
have the tools and the necessary information in order to understand how

344
07:30:50,878 --> 07:30:55,520
you can actually deploy to an iphone and an android phone all right

345
07:30:55,520 --> 07:30:57,680
so uh

346
07:30:57,680 --> 07:31:02,320
with that said now we can say that we're actually good to go on android

347
07:31:02,320 --> 07:31:05,760
um and in the next chapter which is chapter 11 we're going to get to some

348
07:31:05,760 --> 07:31:10,398
juicy stuff which is uh setting up our project on firebase and if you remember

349
07:31:10,398 --> 07:31:13,920
from the introduction we're going to use firebase for our back end

350
07:31:13,920 --> 07:31:17,520
so um then

351
07:31:17,520 --> 07:31:21,360
you know what's coming in the next chapter and uh now you have the tools

352
07:31:21,360 --> 07:31:26,718
necessary in order to get the app running so with that said then let's go

353
07:31:26,718 --> 07:31:30,080
and configure our firebase project in

354
07:31:30,080 --> 07:31:33,760
chapter 11. hello everyone and welcome to chapter 11

355
07:31:33,760 --> 07:31:36,478
of this course in this chapter we're going to talk

356
07:31:36,478 --> 07:31:40,080
about our back end setup which is with firebase

357
07:31:40,080 --> 07:31:45,120
um and i'm as i as i've said it before i kind of assume that you've gone through

358
07:31:45,120 --> 07:31:49,040
the chapters of this course chronologically so you started

359
07:31:49,040 --> 07:31:51,440
from the absolute beginning introduction and then

360
07:31:51,440 --> 07:31:55,040
you're following along so there's lots and lots of lots of information as you

361
07:31:55,040 --> 07:31:58,840
can see it's about eight hours of information before this chapter

362
07:31:58,840 --> 07:32:02,958
so i feel like since i've explained everything so thoroughly in all those

363
07:32:02,958 --> 07:32:06,958
chapters i'm not going to go through all that again

364
07:32:06,958 --> 07:32:10,638
so i will jump over stuff that i've already explained so i if you haven't

365
07:32:10,638 --> 07:32:15,280
watched those chapters i really suggest that you at least skim

366
07:32:15,280 --> 07:32:19,440
over them a little bit so you see so you get the gist of it

367
07:32:19,440 --> 07:32:23,520
um now i'm looking at my notes and i can see

368
07:32:23,520 --> 07:32:27,520
that in this chapter as the caption shows here we're gonna set up our back

369
07:32:27,520 --> 07:32:33,920
end our backend is using firebase and while developing this course i

370
07:32:33,920 --> 07:32:38,240
contemplated creating a like as a part of this course have a

371
07:32:38,240 --> 07:32:42,240
custom backend as well that we do with django i personally do django

372
07:32:42,240 --> 07:32:47,520
development uh for back-end and websites like rest apis and also for

373
07:32:47,520 --> 07:32:51,600
simple websites as well but to be honest with you if i then go

374
07:32:51,600 --> 07:32:56,080
and create a simple back-end with django and then show you how to integrate with

375
07:32:56,080 --> 07:32:59,920
that using flutter it really has nothing to do with flutter

376
07:32:59,920 --> 07:33:04,558
like the backend part has nothing to do with flutter itself so

377
07:33:04,558 --> 07:33:07,520
having that issue in the beginning of this course i

378
07:33:07,520 --> 07:33:12,798
was faced with a challenge of do i go into the rabbit hole of creating custom

379
07:33:12,798 --> 07:33:15,120
back for this course

380
07:33:15,120 --> 07:33:18,080
and walk you through also creating a custom package which has nothing to do

381
07:33:18,080 --> 07:33:23,280
with flutter and flutter is the reason you were watching this course so i

382
07:33:23,280 --> 07:33:29,520
was faced with that challenge of whether i should do that or just use uh firebase

383
07:33:29,520 --> 07:33:34,240
and i choose and i chose firebase simply because it is a product by google it is

384
07:33:34,240 --> 07:33:37,600
kind of like serverless so it is a server without you actually having to

385
07:33:37,600 --> 07:33:42,558
write code as such so i picked firebase for its simplicity

386
07:33:42,558 --> 07:33:48,080
so that we can get the backend working up and running without so much work and

387
07:33:48,080 --> 07:33:51,440
i hope that you understand that that is the reason that we're not doing a custom

388
07:33:51,440 --> 07:33:55,040
back-end but firebase is a very reliable uh

389
07:33:55,040 --> 07:34:00,558
back-end created by google and it has all google's financial backing for

390
07:34:00,558 --> 07:34:04,080
further developments and for support so you

391
07:34:04,080 --> 07:34:07,280
don't have to worry if you're picking firebase and if you're thinking oh is it

392
07:34:07,280 --> 07:34:11,840
going to continue being supported the quick answer is yes it is going to

393
07:34:11,840 --> 07:34:16,000
be supported it is so big everyone's using it and it's too big even to fail i

394
07:34:16,000 --> 07:34:19,200
would say right now at least for the

395
07:34:19,200 --> 07:34:24,240
uh upcoming uh next few years i would say

396
07:34:24,240 --> 07:34:28,160
i can't predict the future for 10 20 years in the future but

397
07:34:28,160 --> 07:34:32,000
for now you don't have to worry about that so

398
07:34:32,000 --> 07:34:35,920
um so that's what we are going to do in

399
07:34:35,920 --> 07:34:39,280
this chapter i'm just going to take it in my notes um

400
07:34:39,280 --> 07:34:45,520
now previously when uh flutter came out like in year 2020 or even the beginning

401
07:34:45,520 --> 07:34:50,000
of 2021 if you want to integrate with

402
07:34:50,000 --> 07:34:53,120
firebase you have to do a lot of custom work

403
07:34:53,120 --> 07:34:57,760
now in the recent versions of flutter

404
07:34:57,760 --> 07:35:01,760
there is a a command that you can issue from your

405
07:35:01,760 --> 07:35:08,080
terminal it is called flutter fire cli and this command

406
07:35:08,080 --> 07:35:12,718
is amazing because like the work that you have to previously do manually a lot

407
07:35:12,718 --> 07:35:17,760
of custom work dragging files and p lists and jsons configurations app ids

408
07:35:17,760 --> 07:35:23,040
etc etc it was such a big undertaking that a lot of developers

409
07:35:23,040 --> 07:35:28,320
would make a lot of mistakes during that process and it was just not good so

410
07:35:28,320 --> 07:35:31,360
um there is now a command that you can

411
07:35:31,360 --> 07:35:35,280
issue from from your terminal which allows you to do all that custom work

412
07:35:35,280 --> 07:35:39,600
but it does it for you so you don't have to do do that manually so

413
07:35:39,600 --> 07:35:43,360
as i provided here there is a link i'm going to open that link

414
07:35:43,360 --> 07:35:48,240
if i can somewhere let's see if i can bring up safari

415
07:35:48,240 --> 07:35:53,440
it opens in a wrong screen i'll bring that screen here

416
07:35:53,440 --> 07:35:58,718
so you'll see it as well enlarge that screen and also enlarge the

417
07:35:58,718 --> 07:36:03,040
font so it is more visible so you can see it says fluffifier

418
07:36:03,040 --> 07:36:06,000
overview and it says get to know firebase for

419
07:36:06,000 --> 07:36:09,280
flutter we recommend starting with the get to

420
07:36:09,280 --> 07:36:12,798
know firebase for flutter code lab and video okay so there's a video here if

421
07:36:12,798 --> 07:36:16,558
you want to watch it and uh and it says okay if you're

422
07:36:16,558 --> 07:36:20,558
migrating your existing project then look at the migration guide migrating if

423
07:36:20,558 --> 07:36:23,840
you're not familiar with that term uh if you're not coming from a software

424
07:36:23,840 --> 07:36:27,360
engineer background migrating economy so you have an existing thing and you want

425
07:36:27,360 --> 07:36:30,958
to make it newer like

426
07:36:30,958 --> 07:36:35,440
and put in new stuff in it so you kind of migrate your information from the old

427
07:36:35,440 --> 07:36:38,638
project to the new one so but in this case we don't have to worry

428
07:36:38,638 --> 07:36:43,360
about that because we're we've created a brand new project so there's no existing

429
07:36:43,360 --> 07:36:47,760
firebase installation in our application that we have to worry about okay

430
07:36:47,760 --> 07:36:53,040
there's a lot of information here you can see it says using the cli etc etc

431
07:36:53,040 --> 07:36:56,638
and that is actually what we're going to do now

432
07:36:56,638 --> 07:37:02,000
we are going to have a look at how we can install the flutter fire cli

433
07:37:02,000 --> 07:37:05,920
and you can see here it says you should execute the dart pop global activate

434
07:37:05,920 --> 07:37:09,520
flussifier cli and then you issue flutter fire

435
07:37:09,520 --> 07:37:14,638
flussifier config so let's start by copying this code from here copy it and

436
07:37:14,638 --> 07:37:18,878
i'm going to bring up my terminal and i'm going to increase the size of my

437
07:37:18,878 --> 07:37:23,360
terminal so you actually see what is happening here okay so i'm gonna paste

438
07:37:23,360 --> 07:37:27,840
that command in and i'm gonna let it do its thing

439
07:37:27,840 --> 07:37:31,440
i've already done this installation before so for me it may actually go a

440
07:37:31,440 --> 07:37:34,398
little bit smoother or a little bit faster but for you it may take a little

441
07:37:34,398 --> 07:37:38,320
bit longer depending on whether you've already installed flat of rsli before or

442
07:37:38,320 --> 07:37:41,280
not so now that that is installed the next

443
07:37:41,280 --> 07:37:45,920
thing you will have to do is you will actually need to make sure i mean it's

444
07:37:45,920 --> 07:37:48,798
not provided in the documentation but it's something that i'm providing for

445
07:37:48,798 --> 07:37:53,120
you because i know that i've personally run into this issue before

446
07:37:53,120 --> 07:37:55,680
so um

447
07:37:55,680 --> 07:38:01,520
this flutter fire cli it will give you this command as you can see here flutter

448
07:38:01,520 --> 07:38:07,200
fire okay and if i in my terminal say which flutter fire

449
07:38:07,200 --> 07:38:11,360
you can see that flutter fire is installed in this folder so it's under

450
07:38:11,360 --> 07:38:17,200
my personal folder on my computer slash dot pop cache slash bin and then

451
07:38:17,200 --> 07:38:21,840
right there so unfortunately when you install lots of fire cli it doesn't

452
07:38:21,840 --> 07:38:26,240
it doesn't tell your terminal where it is installed so if you then immediately

453
07:38:26,240 --> 07:38:31,040
after that say flutter fire and then blah blah blah as it is mentioned here

454
07:38:31,040 --> 07:38:35,120
classifier configure your terminal will most probably say that what is flutter

455
07:38:35,120 --> 07:38:36,798
fire so

456
07:38:36,798 --> 07:38:39,360
it's not provided here in the documentation but i'm telling you here

457
07:38:39,360 --> 07:38:42,958
as you can see in the caption that you need to tell your terminal where flutter

458
07:38:42,958 --> 07:38:47,280
fire is actually installed okay so

459
07:38:47,280 --> 07:38:51,360
um then what you'll need to do is uh to do

460
07:38:51,360 --> 07:38:54,638
as i've mentioned here you can see i've said that you need to change your path

461
07:38:54,638 --> 07:39:00,638
and include your home folder slash pop cache slash bin so if i go to my

462
07:39:00,638 --> 07:39:06,840
terminal configuration if i say um in

463
07:39:06,840 --> 07:39:11,200
vshrc you can see at the top here somewhere i

464
07:39:11,200 --> 07:39:17,280
should have there you see it says export path and i say okay my new path is the

465
07:39:17,280 --> 07:39:22,958
old path plus using this uh double column here or column

466
07:39:22,958 --> 07:39:26,718
this folder as i've mentioned here in the captions at the bottom of the screen

467
07:39:26,718 --> 07:39:31,120
so you will need to do this as well so i'm going to quit vim now and then after

468
07:39:31,120 --> 07:39:37,040
you've done that make sure that you source that

469
07:39:37,040 --> 07:39:40,398
configuration so in my case i would have to say source

470
07:39:40,398 --> 07:39:45,520
zsh rc and that will read the paths um

471
07:39:45,520 --> 07:39:49,360
fresh otherwise you could also take the high road and like

472
07:39:49,360 --> 07:39:52,878
close your terminal completely terminated and then start it again which

473
07:39:52,878 --> 07:39:56,958
in turn reads the configuration and brings flutter fire a path

474
07:39:56,958 --> 07:40:00,240
into existence

475
07:40:00,240 --> 07:40:03,920
if you don't want to source that's what i mean

476
07:40:03,920 --> 07:40:07,120
so now we've talked about that now let's

477
07:40:07,120 --> 07:40:12,080
actually talk about what the firebase cli is

478
07:40:12,080 --> 07:40:17,440
it is a um actually let me make sure i tick all of these items that

479
07:40:17,440 --> 07:40:20,958
i talked about

480
07:40:20,958 --> 07:40:24,798
in right now let me just mark them as done

481
07:40:24,798 --> 07:40:29,200
in my notes so

482
07:40:29,200 --> 07:40:33,040
um so what you need to do now is what we

483
07:40:33,040 --> 07:40:37,040
need to do now is to talk about firebase cli

484
07:40:37,040 --> 07:40:40,398
and um as you can see here is a cli to help us

485
07:40:40,398 --> 07:40:43,760
interact with firebase right from our terminal now

486
07:40:43,760 --> 07:40:47,440
um this this used to be done manually

487
07:40:47,440 --> 07:40:51,520
previously in that you would have to go to firebase and like create a whole

488
07:40:51,520 --> 07:40:55,760
separate project and then integrate that project into your flosser application so

489
07:40:55,760 --> 07:40:58,798
you don't have to do any of that anymore so

490
07:40:58,798 --> 07:41:03,920
um what you need to do now is as the next step is to install the firebase cli

491
07:41:03,920 --> 07:41:09,600
which does all of that work for you so i've provided here as you can see

492
07:41:09,600 --> 07:41:13,600
there is a command here that you can issue

493
07:41:13,600 --> 07:41:19,600
and then you can go to a firebase google com docs cli install cli mac blah blah

494
07:41:19,600 --> 07:41:24,080
so i'm actually going to go to that location

495
07:41:24,080 --> 07:41:29,280
in my web browser here so you can see what i'm doing

496
07:41:29,280 --> 07:41:33,040
here and you will see there's a lot of

497
07:41:33,040 --> 07:41:36,798
information provided here i'm going to bring up the uh i'm going to make the

498
07:41:36,798 --> 07:41:39,600
size a little bit bigger i'm going to bring my face maybe to the bottom right

499
07:41:39,600 --> 07:41:42,958
as well so you can see more information on the screen

500
07:41:42,958 --> 07:41:46,718
and you can see for mac or linux then there is

501
07:41:46,718 --> 07:41:50,320
yeah let's go here mag you can install the firebase cli for macro linux using

502
07:41:50,320 --> 07:41:55,120
one of the following options so standalone binary blah blah so you

503
07:41:55,120 --> 07:41:59,040
need to have a look at this documentation on on how you can install

504
07:41:59,040 --> 07:42:03,360
the firebase cli on your on your computer whether you're using mac or

505
07:42:03,360 --> 07:42:09,280
whether you're using linux or windows so

506
07:42:09,280 --> 07:42:11,920
so after you've done that after you've

507
07:42:11,920 --> 07:42:19,600
installed the firebase cli you will actually need to

508
07:42:19,600 --> 07:42:23,760
log in in your into your account using that

509
07:42:23,760 --> 07:42:26,958
firebase cli

510
07:42:26,958 --> 07:42:30,398
so let's let's do that let me actually in

511
07:42:30,398 --> 07:42:37,440
here um let's bring up our project uh in visual studio code so i'm gonna bring it

512
07:42:37,440 --> 07:42:41,440
up here and bring up the right caption as well

513
07:42:41,440 --> 07:42:44,558
so you see what we're talking about we're going to talk about firebase login

514
07:42:44,558 --> 07:42:49,200
and log out you see when you want to integrate your flutter

515
07:42:49,200 --> 07:42:52,798
application with firebase you need to create a

516
07:42:52,798 --> 07:42:56,840
firebase project on something called the firebase console

517
07:42:56,840 --> 07:43:03,600
so this project is pretty much the configuration of your firebase backend

518
07:43:03,600 --> 07:43:08,478
on firebase's console on their website so you need to configure a backend so

519
07:43:08,478 --> 07:43:13,360
what we need to do here is now before we can actually configure it back in

520
07:43:13,360 --> 07:43:19,040
in your terminal you need to tell firebase what user you have because i

521
07:43:19,040 --> 07:43:23,040
personally have many google accounts and any one of those google accounts can

522
07:43:23,040 --> 07:43:28,240
potentially have many flutter sorry many firebase projects

523
07:43:28,240 --> 07:43:32,878
because firebase projects are linked to your google accounts okay

524
07:43:32,878 --> 07:43:39,920
now in order for our firebase cli to understand where it needs to create the

525
07:43:39,920 --> 07:43:44,718
project you need to tell it to log in with an account all right so

526
07:43:44,718 --> 07:43:48,558
the way to do that is to bring up terminal and as you can see here is my

527
07:43:48,558 --> 07:43:51,520
terminal and i'm going to clean this a little bit

528
07:43:51,520 --> 07:43:56,718
i'm going to bring up the font as well so it's quite ginormous and that's okay

529
07:43:56,718 --> 07:44:01,280
so what you need to do now is to tell it to log in

530
07:44:01,280 --> 07:44:08,000
so i'm going to say firebase login okay

531
07:44:08,000 --> 07:44:11,840
it's gonna do its work and it's telling me i'm already logged in with this

532
07:44:11,840 --> 07:44:15,840
account if you haven't logged in with an account then you're gonna get a prompt

533
07:44:15,840 --> 07:44:21,840
telling you uh okay which email and password do you wanna log in with so

534
07:44:21,840 --> 07:44:24,798
now um it may be actually worth it to be

535
07:44:24,798 --> 07:44:28,638
honest with you for me to log out right now so that you see the entire process

536
07:44:28,638 --> 07:44:32,478
so i'm a bit hesitant to log out because

537
07:44:32,478 --> 07:44:36,878
uh i actually have protected my google account with a security key

538
07:44:36,878 --> 07:44:40,160
so i don't have the key right here and i

539
07:44:40,160 --> 07:44:44,798
hope that i can find it so for the sake of for the sake of actually

540
07:44:44,798 --> 07:44:48,478
going through this process together with you so you see how it works i'm gonna

541
07:44:48,478 --> 07:44:52,558
log out so let's log out here

542
07:44:52,558 --> 07:44:57,760
so i'm saying firebase logout and it says there is a new version of a

543
07:44:57,760 --> 07:45:04,080
firebase tool so let's copy this here and i'm gonna see if we can install

544
07:45:04,080 --> 07:45:07,840
um what did it say npm install

545
07:45:07,840 --> 07:45:15,520
global so let's copy that here global firebase tools okay

546
07:45:15,520 --> 07:45:19,520
if it can do its work then before we can continue

547
07:45:19,520 --> 07:45:25,280
and npm is something called a node package manager and it is kind of like

548
07:45:25,280 --> 07:45:29,200
if you're working with node.js if you're developing for instance node

549
07:45:29,200 --> 07:45:32,080
applications which you which you don't have to know

550
07:45:32,080 --> 07:45:37,600
about it's just a way it's like a tool kit for creating applications uh

551
07:45:37,600 --> 07:45:42,080
remove the existing file and try again or npm with force okay

552
07:45:42,080 --> 07:45:48,798
npm install global with dash dash force i think

553
07:45:48,798 --> 07:45:51,360
yeah so it's it's like a dependency

554
07:45:51,360 --> 07:45:55,840
management for node applications and firebase tools is

555
07:45:55,840 --> 07:46:00,240
a node application so that's all you need to know really i mean there's there

556
07:46:00,240 --> 07:46:04,160
are courses available about node and node.js then you can actually have a

557
07:46:04,160 --> 07:46:09,120
look at how they work etc so i'm not going to go into details about that so

558
07:46:09,120 --> 07:46:13,440
before i could i mean i could have actually done a firebase logout without

559
07:46:13,440 --> 07:46:17,840
all of this but i just want to show you that things aren't planned like i can't

560
07:46:17,840 --> 07:46:21,200
perfectly plan things here and when i tried to log out it said oh there's a

561
07:46:21,200 --> 07:46:24,240
new version of node available blah blah so

562
07:46:24,240 --> 07:46:28,000
now that i think sorry there's a new version of firebase tools available that

563
07:46:28,000 --> 07:46:31,200
you can use that you can install with npm so

564
07:46:31,200 --> 07:46:37,680
i did that so let's now say uh firebase logout

565
07:46:37,680 --> 07:46:40,840
okay so the logit actually was successful

566
07:46:40,840 --> 07:46:46,240
previously and so let's now say firebase login

567
07:46:46,240 --> 07:46:49,760
and it says allow firebase to collect cli usage and error reporting

568
07:46:49,760 --> 07:46:53,440
information i'm gonna say as a developer to be honest with you

569
07:46:53,440 --> 07:46:59,440
you may you may be tended to say no like here but if you are a developer you can

570
07:46:59,440 --> 07:47:02,878
put your shoe you can put yourself in the shoes of another developer working

571
07:47:02,878 --> 07:47:07,520
at google working for firebase and they are trying to get some information about

572
07:47:07,520 --> 07:47:12,558
how you use the cli and whether they can learn from your usage of the cli in

573
07:47:12,558 --> 07:47:17,120
order to make the cli better so i usually say yes to these things

574
07:47:17,120 --> 07:47:20,878
especially if there's a developer asking for permission so but you can say no to

575
07:47:20,878 --> 07:47:23,440
this if you want to so i'm just going to say yes

576
07:47:23,440 --> 07:47:27,440
and you can see here then there's a screen provided here asking me to log in

577
07:47:27,440 --> 07:47:30,958
with one of my google accounts all right and

578
07:47:30,958 --> 07:47:34,000
i'm going to pick my company's google account because that's what i usually

579
07:47:34,000 --> 07:47:38,398
use all right so i'm going to choose that and it says firebase cli wants to

580
07:47:38,398 --> 07:47:42,798
access your google account and it says okay what permissions it's going to use

581
07:47:42,798 --> 07:47:45,520
you can have a look at this information if you want to

582
07:47:45,520 --> 07:47:49,200
if it concerns you so if you if you're concerned about any of these things

583
07:47:49,200 --> 07:47:52,638
please go and read the links provided here

584
07:47:52,638 --> 07:47:55,760
i'm just going to say allow and once that is done you will see that

585
07:47:55,760 --> 07:48:00,240
it says firebase cli login successful and then you can pretty much just close

586
07:48:00,240 --> 07:48:06,080
this window safely and now it says logged in as pixelityav

587
07:48:06,080 --> 07:48:11,360
gmail.com so i can say firebase login again and that would be the prompt that

588
07:48:11,360 --> 07:48:16,718
you saw in the beginning of this video that you are logged in alright

589
07:48:16,718 --> 07:48:19,360
good that was a lot of information now now

590
07:48:19,360 --> 07:48:25,520
that you are logged in with the firebase cli you actually need to configure a

591
07:48:25,520 --> 07:48:31,280
firebase project all right and we do that with the flutter fire cli which we

592
07:48:31,280 --> 07:48:34,958
installed in the beginning of this chapter using this command dart pop

593
07:48:34,958 --> 07:48:41,040
global activate all right so what you need to do now is to

594
07:48:41,040 --> 07:48:44,558
issue the flutter fire configure

595
07:48:44,558 --> 07:48:48,798
command as i've shown here down at on the left hand side so i'm going to do

596
07:48:48,798 --> 07:48:54,398
that flutter fire configure so it will fetch all the projects that

597
07:48:54,398 --> 07:48:59,920
i've already created in my google account and it says okay these

598
07:48:59,920 --> 07:49:04,798
are the projects available flash chat fluffer note guessing chords random

599
07:49:04,798 --> 07:49:09,360
project testing or you can create a new project

600
07:49:09,360 --> 07:49:12,878
now i'm going to choose create a new project here okay

601
07:49:12,878 --> 07:49:16,000
and it says okay enter a project id for your

602
07:49:16,000 --> 07:49:20,798
new firebase project so what i'm going to do here is i'm just going to type my

603
07:49:20,798 --> 07:49:23,920
notes all right so

604
07:49:23,920 --> 07:49:28,638
as you can see my notes is the name of our flutter project as

605
07:49:28,638 --> 07:49:32,320
well so my notes now i'm going to say okay i'm going to create the same

606
07:49:32,320 --> 07:49:37,280
project called my notes okay i'm going to press enter here

607
07:49:37,280 --> 07:49:40,718
i says yeah i'm going to create it and it's probably

608
07:49:40,718 --> 07:49:44,718
i mean you can see that we immediately got an error saying that

609
07:49:44,718 --> 07:49:47,200
this project already exists and you can see

610
07:49:47,200 --> 07:49:49,760
um command blah blah blah yeah fail to

611
07:49:49,760 --> 07:49:52,558
create a project because there's already a project with

612
07:49:52,558 --> 07:49:56,878
with id mynotes please try again with a unique project id so

613
07:49:56,878 --> 07:50:01,120
this is basically telling us that hey someone else has created my notes and it

614
07:50:01,120 --> 07:50:04,958
wasn't one of the projects that we had created because if you if you have a

615
07:50:04,958 --> 07:50:08,718
look at your if you open uh your web browser and say

616
07:50:08,718 --> 07:50:14,240
firebase console go to your firebase console

617
07:50:14,240 --> 07:50:19,360
and uh let me make sure that i'm logged in with my pixelity account yes

618
07:50:19,360 --> 07:50:23,680
and if i have a look let's see dismiss let's

619
07:50:23,680 --> 07:50:27,920
see get started firebase helps you watch

620
07:50:27,920 --> 07:50:30,798
demo yeah we are logged in with that account

621
07:50:30,798 --> 07:50:34,398
so i can actually see maybe i don't have any projects set up here which is a

622
07:50:34,398 --> 07:50:37,600
little bit weird because we actually saw that there were some

623
07:50:37,600 --> 07:50:41,440
projects set up under this account so i don't understand why the firebase

624
07:50:41,440 --> 07:50:44,878
console so it's not showing them um

625
07:50:44,878 --> 07:50:49,280
firebase console backed by google firebase console google

626
07:50:49,280 --> 07:50:54,798
yeah there they are okay so it is on console.firebase.google okay

627
07:50:54,798 --> 07:51:00,558
and i can see that my notes application is not an application that i own i

628
07:51:00,558 --> 07:51:05,840
haven't created that so what it is saying is that globally

629
07:51:05,840 --> 07:51:09,760
firebase projects have an identifier and now i've entered an identifier that is

630
07:51:09,760 --> 07:51:13,120
already taken so what i'm going to do then is i'm going

631
07:51:13,120 --> 07:51:18,878
to issue the same command uh firebase flutter fire configure and this

632
07:51:18,878 --> 07:51:22,080
time i'm going to give it a little bit more information about the project name

633
07:51:22,080 --> 07:51:26,878
so that makes it a little bit more unique so i'm going to choose

634
07:51:26,878 --> 07:51:29,920
create a new project and then in here in the name of the

635
07:51:29,920 --> 07:51:36,558
project i'm going to say mynotes flutter project

636
07:51:36,558 --> 07:51:40,000
maybe someone has already taken this as well

637
07:51:40,000 --> 07:51:42,638
i don't know

638
07:51:42,638 --> 07:51:51,760
so it's doing its thing it's doing its magic basically so let's have a look

639
07:51:51,760 --> 07:51:55,440
and i mean this is okay that is taking some time it

640
07:51:55,440 --> 07:51:58,798
is doing a lot of work it's setting up like the ios project and android project

641
07:51:58,798 --> 07:52:02,478
etc so this thing used to take a lot of time to

642
07:52:02,478 --> 07:52:06,638
do by hand like maybe 10 folds the amount of time that this

643
07:52:06,638 --> 07:52:11,360
cli is taking so i'm not so bothered by the fact that it's taking some time so

644
07:52:11,360 --> 07:52:14,718
and here it will actually tell you okay which platforms do you want to select

645
07:52:14,718 --> 07:52:19,840
and as i said like flutter allows you to create web applications android

646
07:52:19,840 --> 07:52:23,360
applications ios applications and also uh

647
07:52:23,360 --> 07:52:27,680
desktop applications or four platforms and then here it says okay which ones do

648
07:52:27,680 --> 07:52:31,600
you want to create for our project right now you can just

649
07:52:31,600 --> 07:52:35,440
say android and ios you don't have to worry about like

650
07:52:35,440 --> 07:52:40,240
um mac os or linux or windows and web but

651
07:52:40,240 --> 07:52:43,920
you have the ability to do that if you want to so choose android and ios for

652
07:52:43,920 --> 07:52:53,760
now and press enter so it's gonna do its work

653
07:52:53,760 --> 07:52:58,478
so let it do its magic

654
07:52:58,478 --> 07:53:03,360
and now this is this is the amazing part that you had to do manually before you

655
07:53:03,360 --> 07:53:08,160
had to previously go and register like your application with

656
07:53:08,160 --> 07:53:11,440
apple and then go and register bundle identifier and then put the bundle

657
07:53:11,440 --> 07:53:15,520
identifier manually in firebase and then download some files put those files in

658
07:53:15,520 --> 07:53:19,200
your ios and android project now now you don't have to do that anymore

659
07:53:19,200 --> 07:53:22,798
here it just tells you which bundle identifier are you using for your

660
07:53:22,798 --> 07:53:26,798
project and if you remember from before when we created our flutter project from

661
07:53:26,798 --> 07:53:33,360
the beginning we said flutter create and then an organization which for me was s

662
07:53:33,360 --> 07:53:35,920
e dot pixolity do you remember that command

663
07:53:35,920 --> 07:53:40,398
it kind of looked like um i mean if i bring up terminal maybe i

664
07:53:40,398 --> 07:53:45,280
can even go back to it flutter create do you remember this command i will zoom

665
07:53:45,280 --> 07:53:48,878
into it a little bit so you can see better this is how we actually created

666
07:53:48,878 --> 07:53:54,000
our project we said flutter create.org as he pixeled in my notes so the bundle

667
07:53:54,000 --> 07:53:57,680
identifier for this application will be sepixolity.mynotes

668
07:53:57,680 --> 07:54:02,398
however since sc pixelity is the reverse domain for me this won't this won't be

669
07:54:02,398 --> 07:54:06,000
the case for you so go back to how you created that

670
07:54:06,000 --> 07:54:09,840
identifier for a project using your organization name and you now you have

671
07:54:09,840 --> 07:54:14,160
to paste that in here so you will see i'm going to say s e

672
07:54:14,160 --> 07:54:19,280
pixelity dot my notes okay

673
07:54:19,280 --> 07:54:24,798
so enter that and it's going to configure your ios

674
07:54:24,798 --> 07:54:30,320
project for you

675
07:54:30,320 --> 07:54:33,920
and that was it so it has now

676
07:54:33,920 --> 07:54:38,718
set up everything necessary for your project to work so i mean you may you

677
07:54:38,718 --> 07:54:42,718
may just think oh well this was this was so little and what did it actually do

678
07:54:42,718 --> 07:54:47,120
but for me who's been working with firebase and flutter for a very long

679
07:54:47,120 --> 07:54:50,080
time this is all magical because it did a lot

680
07:54:50,080 --> 07:54:54,080
of work it configured your application on the firebase console it actually

681
07:54:54,080 --> 07:54:59,760
registered an android and an ios project hooked into this firebase project

682
07:54:59,760 --> 07:55:05,040
downloaded the configuration files place them in the exact correct place in your

683
07:55:05,040 --> 07:55:08,558
application so it did a lot of work but you don't

684
07:55:08,558 --> 07:55:13,360
really have to know about that so um now if you want to kind of see the

685
07:55:13,360 --> 07:55:17,280
result of it if you see here the output of this says that there is an identifier

686
07:55:17,280 --> 07:55:21,280
associated with your ios app and then there's an identifier associated with

687
07:55:21,280 --> 07:55:25,760
your android app so that's what we're going to do now

688
07:55:25,760 --> 07:55:30,478
let's now make sure that these identifiers are correct and that the

689
07:55:30,478 --> 07:55:35,600
bundle identifier that we provided to the cli is also placed in the

690
07:55:35,600 --> 07:55:40,160
configuration file correctly so copy this for instance ios identifier

691
07:55:40,160 --> 07:55:45,120
that was created for you so copy it and then search for it in your entire

692
07:55:45,120 --> 07:55:49,360
project and then you'll find a little file here and let me bring it down

693
07:55:49,360 --> 07:55:53,840
it is called firebaseoptions.dart

694
07:55:53,840 --> 07:55:59,600
so this is where ios is configured and let me bring this like that so you don't

695
07:55:59,600 --> 07:56:02,398
see it and this is where the android project is

696
07:56:02,398 --> 07:56:08,638
configured you can see the um app id is right here and the api key is

697
07:56:08,638 --> 07:56:13,200
right there so don't worry about this i mean you should not show your api key

698
07:56:13,200 --> 07:56:19,520
and app id to anybody um so but since i'm developing this course for you i

699
07:56:19,520 --> 07:56:23,040
have to show it i can't just go and censor it but don't worry about it by

700
07:56:23,040 --> 07:56:26,878
the time you're seeing this um video by the time you're seeing this course i've

701
07:56:26,878 --> 07:56:30,080
already deleted this project from firebase so there's not going to be any

702
07:56:30,080 --> 07:56:33,600
security risk involved so um

703
07:56:33,600 --> 07:56:37,040
so that project isn't going to exist even if you know the api key on app id

704
07:56:37,040 --> 07:56:41,120
so don't worry about that but if you are developing your own application just

705
07:56:41,120 --> 07:56:46,878
kind of be careful who you share your api key and app id with all right

706
07:56:46,878 --> 07:56:52,718
that was a lot of information a lot a lot a lot so um

707
07:56:52,718 --> 07:56:59,280
and i'm gonna actually tick here that we've talked about that

708
07:56:59,280 --> 07:57:04,798
i create a new project and yeah that's that's all working as it

709
07:57:04,798 --> 07:57:08,398
should so i'm also gonna go here in the

710
07:57:08,398 --> 07:57:12,398
captions and i can see that i have some information here about enabling

711
07:57:12,398 --> 07:57:17,040
multi-decks and multi-dex was something that we've already enabled in the

712
07:57:17,040 --> 07:57:21,120
previous chapter which was chapter 10 for the android project so

713
07:57:21,120 --> 07:57:25,280
now everything should be working as it did before to be honest with you so if

714
07:57:25,280 --> 07:57:29,040
you in your visual studio code or android studio if you're developing

715
07:57:29,040 --> 07:57:32,000
under your flutter app with android studio you can also

716
07:57:32,000 --> 07:57:36,718
go and select your device to run on now in the previous chapter you saw that for

717
07:57:36,718 --> 07:57:40,558
the entirety of this chat in this course i'm gonna use an android phone to

718
07:57:40,558 --> 07:57:45,920
develop uh our application so you may choose to use an io simulator an android

719
07:57:45,920 --> 07:57:49,920
emulator or an android phone or tablet or ios phone or tablet so but i'm gonna

720
07:57:49,920 --> 07:57:56,160
use a real android phone and as you saw we have the ability to bring up scr cpy

721
07:57:56,160 --> 07:58:02,878
to mirror the android screen so i'm going to bring it right here

722
07:58:02,878 --> 07:58:06,558
change the size of visual studio codes window a little bit so you can see the

723
07:58:06,558 --> 07:58:10,558
android um telephone right there as well then what i'm going to do

724
07:58:10,558 --> 07:58:14,718
just to make sure that the project runs after all of this work that we've done

725
07:58:14,718 --> 07:58:19,200
so that we haven't broken anything really let's then go and

726
07:58:19,200 --> 07:58:23,040
debug the application sorry run it without debugging and this

727
07:58:23,040 --> 07:58:27,120
is this is why you will see this is the result of all the work that we've done

728
07:58:27,120 --> 07:58:30,638
pretty much nothing this is like

729
07:58:30,638 --> 07:58:33,760
i mean it sounds funny to say it because we did

730
07:58:33,760 --> 07:58:37,440
a lot of work with the firebase project but there is nothing that you can see on

731
07:58:37,440 --> 07:58:40,718
the screen and that's that's the reality of doing software development you may be

732
07:58:40,718 --> 07:58:44,240
putting a lot of work sometimes in doing something and this result isn't

733
07:58:44,240 --> 07:58:48,638
immediately visible all right so but what you have done in this

734
07:58:48,638 --> 07:58:52,240
chapter was that you actually set up your back end with just a few commands

735
07:58:52,240 --> 07:58:57,360
you installed two clis the flutter fire cli and the firebase cli you logged in

736
07:58:57,360 --> 07:59:02,398
with firebase cli and then you set up your backend with the flutter fire cli

737
07:59:02,398 --> 07:59:04,798
all right now just to make sure everything is set

738
07:59:04,798 --> 07:59:08,398
up properly also you can bring up your web browser i'm gonna bring it up here

739
07:59:08,398 --> 07:59:12,958
and i'm gonna say console.firebase and

740
07:59:12,958 --> 07:59:16,558
let me make sure that we have

741
07:59:16,558 --> 07:59:20,558
our notes app here you can see my node slatter project

742
07:59:20,558 --> 07:59:23,760
and you can click on it and you can see how it is set up for you you can see

743
07:59:23,760 --> 07:59:27,920
there is an android app setup and an ios app setup so

744
07:59:27,920 --> 07:59:31,520
you didn't have to really do anything now there's lots of things you can do

745
07:59:31,520 --> 07:59:34,558
with firebase which we're going to actually play with throughout this

746
07:59:34,558 --> 07:59:38,878
course but not right now just make sure that your

747
07:59:38,878 --> 07:59:45,280
firebase project is created for you by logging into console.firebase.google.com

748
07:59:45,280 --> 07:59:48,160
many dots

749
07:59:48,160 --> 07:59:52,798
all right and we've talked about this now running the application on an

750
07:59:52,798 --> 07:59:57,040
android telephone so that was already set up so we don't have

751
07:59:57,040 --> 08:00:00,718
to talk about that now now that you've seen that you've set up

752
08:00:00,718 --> 08:00:06,558
your backend you're ready to go and uh so i can say congratulations so that's

753
08:00:06,558 --> 08:00:10,080
in order now

754
08:00:10,080 --> 08:00:13,360
the android setup is already done so i can see that that is set up we don't

755
08:00:13,360 --> 08:00:18,080
have to talk about that either however

756
08:00:18,080 --> 08:00:21,760
what we do need to talk about is what we're gonna

757
08:00:21,760 --> 08:00:26,558
discuss in the next chapter so

758
08:00:26,558 --> 08:00:31,680
in the next chapter we are for the first time in this course we are going to talk

759
08:00:31,680 --> 08:00:36,080
about the uh footer code actual thoughts or

760
08:00:36,080 --> 08:00:41,600
code we're going to start writing a simple registration screen so using this

761
08:00:41,600 --> 08:00:46,320
registration screen our right now hypothetical users are going

762
08:00:46,320 --> 08:00:50,638
to look at the screen and say okay i don't

763
08:00:50,638 --> 08:00:54,080
have an account with this application i'm going to register myself so

764
08:00:54,080 --> 08:00:58,000
then you will be able to they will be able to enter

765
08:00:58,000 --> 08:01:03,520
their email address a password of their uh choosing press some sort of a button

766
08:01:03,520 --> 08:01:08,000
and we will then talk with firebase and say here's a new user register that

767
08:01:08,000 --> 08:01:13,840
person okay so that's all for the next chapter which is chapter 12. so grab a

768
08:01:13,840 --> 08:01:16,558
cup of coffee cup of tea whatever you want to do

769
08:01:16,558 --> 08:01:20,878
get refreshed then and i'll see you in the next chapter

770
08:01:20,878 --> 08:01:24,718
hello and welcome to chapter number 12 of this filter course

771
08:01:24,718 --> 08:01:28,080
in this chapter and which i'm very excited about we're going to talk about

772
08:01:28,080 --> 08:01:33,200
a basic register screen well up until this point we've been really configuring

773
08:01:33,200 --> 08:01:36,718
our i mean if we go chronologically we've had the introduction we've gone

774
08:01:36,718 --> 08:01:40,080
through so many chapters to talk about dart and its basics and even some more

775
08:01:40,080 --> 08:01:44,478
advanced topics such as generics

776
08:01:44,478 --> 08:01:49,440
and then as soon as we did that then we

777
08:01:49,440 --> 08:01:53,680
basically started learning about setting up our

778
08:01:53,680 --> 08:01:56,958
iphone and android application also after that

779
08:01:56,958 --> 08:02:01,680
sorry the iphone and android application together with certificates profiles and

780
08:02:01,680 --> 08:02:06,398
got scr cpy working so there's been a lot of information up on those till this

781
08:02:06,398 --> 08:02:10,718
point so many hours of information that you can go back and watch

782
08:02:10,718 --> 08:02:14,320
and i strongly suggest that you actually do that because i've explained

783
08:02:14,320 --> 08:02:19,040
everything in such extent extensive detail that i feel like

784
08:02:19,040 --> 08:02:22,320
explaining all those things again and again will be a waste of time both for

785
08:02:22,320 --> 08:02:24,320
you and me and

786
08:02:24,320 --> 08:02:28,160
in this chapter we are going to use all that information

787
08:02:28,160 --> 08:02:31,280
that we've learned from the previous chapters and start actually creating a

788
08:02:31,280 --> 08:02:34,478
registration screen a simple registration screen in our floater

789
08:02:34,478 --> 08:02:39,600
application source code that talks with firebase and firebase we set up in the

790
08:02:39,600 --> 08:02:44,160
previous chapter if i'm not mistaken so have a look at that chapter if you

791
08:02:44,160 --> 08:02:47,840
haven't set up your firebase app back-end

792
08:02:47,840 --> 08:02:51,680
or at least i mean we haven't really set up anything we've just like

793
08:02:51,680 --> 08:02:55,600
well yeah actually set up yeah we could say set up um but we haven't really

794
08:02:55,600 --> 08:02:59,520
configured in such great details it's just like we've set it up so

795
08:02:59,520 --> 08:03:03,600
have a look at that chapter please if you want to um

796
08:03:03,600 --> 08:03:07,760
before you continue with this chapter so so

797
08:03:07,760 --> 08:03:10,718
i'm gonna go to my captions here and just ensure that i can show you the

798
08:03:10,718 --> 08:03:14,798
correct captions now what we need to do in this chapter

799
08:03:14,798 --> 08:03:18,718
is to start working on our registration screen and what i'm going to do here is

800
08:03:18,718 --> 08:03:22,798
bring up a caption for you so that you know what we're going to do

801
08:03:22,798 --> 08:03:25,600
the first thing you need to do is to bring your

802
08:03:25,600 --> 08:03:29,840
visual studio code or your editor of choice

803
08:03:29,840 --> 08:03:33,120
on the screen so i'm i'm going to do that and then i'm going to bring my

804
08:03:33,120 --> 08:03:37,440
android phone mirrored on the screen with scrcpy

805
08:03:37,440 --> 08:03:40,878
and then i'll see if i can bring my face to the right so you can see a little bit

806
08:03:40,878 --> 08:03:46,958
of a bigger screen and what we need to do here now is to go

807
08:03:46,958 --> 08:03:51,040
in this main dart file and remove everything that is a comment now

808
08:03:51,040 --> 08:03:55,360
if you're coming from like a design background or a product owner or um like

809
08:03:55,360 --> 08:03:58,240
in wherever whatever background that is not

810
08:03:58,240 --> 08:04:01,520
software development related if you're coming from those backgrounds then you

811
08:04:01,520 --> 08:04:06,240
may not know what a comment is however i'll tell you now a comment is a piece

812
08:04:06,240 --> 08:04:09,840
of information piece of text that is written inside a source file such as

813
08:04:09,840 --> 08:04:15,200
this main dart file that doesn't translate to an actual code so it's

814
08:04:15,200 --> 08:04:19,120
information placed there usually for other developers or whoever

815
08:04:19,120 --> 08:04:22,398
is looking at the code so that they understand the code a little bit better

816
08:04:22,398 --> 08:04:24,718
okay comments in dart can be created in

817
08:04:24,718 --> 08:04:30,558
different ways however the most i mean the most usual way of doing it is

818
08:04:30,558 --> 08:04:33,040
with double forward slashes as you can see

819
08:04:33,040 --> 08:04:35,920
here and a space and then some text all right

820
08:04:35,920 --> 08:04:39,440
so i'm going to need you now to go into

821
08:04:39,440 --> 08:04:42,638
your main dart file and we're going to remove all these comments right now

822
08:04:42,638 --> 08:04:47,520
because they are basically creating a lot of noise for us right now okay

823
08:04:47,520 --> 08:04:52,000
so let's go ahead and remove all those gray lines or whatever color they're

824
08:04:52,000 --> 08:04:54,398
displayed on your screen they may be green

825
08:04:54,398 --> 08:04:57,200
depending on your theme

826
08:04:57,200 --> 08:05:00,398
i have tokyo knight as i mentioned before

827
08:05:00,398 --> 08:05:05,280
in visual studio code so comments are displayed in gray

828
08:05:05,280 --> 08:05:09,440
gonna remove all that comment there okay and that's it

829
08:05:09,440 --> 08:05:15,120
so and i think this as well and i don't know yeah and it seems also

830
08:05:15,120 --> 08:05:19,120
like uh so yeah i think now we've removed all

831
08:05:19,120 --> 08:05:23,040
the comments so if i do command s that does a hot

832
08:05:23,040 --> 08:05:25,600
reload and i'm actually going to talk about

833
08:05:25,600 --> 08:05:29,600
what the hot reload is but if you've done this then you're good to go i'm

834
08:05:29,600 --> 08:05:32,958
going to take that in my notes so we've talked about it

835
08:05:32,958 --> 08:05:38,080
now the next topic to talk about here is hot reload versus hot restart now

836
08:05:38,080 --> 08:05:41,680
these two are so important for you to understand that i think you should like

837
08:05:41,680 --> 08:05:45,040
get this before you continue with the rest of the course and i'm gonna do my

838
08:05:45,040 --> 08:05:48,718
best to explain what hot reload and hardware start are

839
08:05:48,718 --> 08:05:51,600
if you're for instance coming from a design background where you have for

840
08:05:51,600 --> 08:05:56,240
instance figma and you design your um

841
08:05:56,240 --> 08:06:00,718
stuff you're you're putting some vectors on the screen you're dragging images and

842
08:06:00,718 --> 08:06:04,160
i can go in your figma design and literally observe you as you're doing

843
08:06:04,160 --> 08:06:08,398
that so i'm actually looking at your changes you don't have to press any

844
08:06:08,398 --> 08:06:12,878
publish button nothing like that even if you're in your drafts i can still follow

845
08:06:12,878 --> 08:06:18,080
you and watch you as you're designing now that future is very very much

846
08:06:18,080 --> 08:06:21,920
possible in flutter as well however

847
08:06:21,920 --> 08:06:27,600
the cost of doing that the same thing that figma does is quite heavy because

848
08:06:27,600 --> 08:06:32,398
as i'm changing my code i actually i'm not going to be able to see my changes

849
08:06:32,398 --> 08:06:37,840
unless i tell flutter that okay i've made some changes show me them on the

850
08:06:37,840 --> 08:06:42,240
screen that is hot reload okay for instance if

851
08:06:42,240 --> 08:06:46,478
i go in here and i say flutter demo home page and remove the demo home page from

852
08:06:46,478 --> 08:06:49,920
here press command s that's going to save my

853
08:06:49,920 --> 08:06:54,240
file which in turn is going to do a hot reload okay

854
08:06:54,240 --> 08:06:58,080
so command s you can see this title now was changed

855
08:06:58,080 --> 08:07:01,040
from here so it's set it says not flutter demo i'm

856
08:07:01,040 --> 08:07:05,920
going to change it back command s hot reload and it's going to say home page

857
08:07:05,920 --> 08:07:10,958
now you can also avoid for instance doing command s and just go in here in

858
08:07:10,958 --> 08:07:15,360
your visual studio code or android studio and just say hot reload so i can

859
08:07:15,360 --> 08:07:20,320
see now that didn't actually do it that was great because i can see a little

860
08:07:20,320 --> 08:07:24,160
like blob here you see the circle on this file this in visual studio code is

861
08:07:24,160 --> 08:07:28,160
an indicator of a file that has not been saved so

862
08:07:28,160 --> 08:07:32,080
so if i save it and it itself is going to do a hot reload so i don't have to

863
08:07:32,080 --> 08:07:35,760
actually manually press the hot reload button so save and then you can see the

864
08:07:35,760 --> 08:07:41,600
changes immediately applied there however some changes to your code are

865
08:07:41,600 --> 08:07:47,920
going to be so big that footwear is not able to resolve the delta from the

866
08:07:47,920 --> 08:07:52,240
previous state of the application to the new states and we will come to those

867
08:07:52,240 --> 08:07:56,478
changes very difficult to explain them right now but just know that hot reload

868
08:07:56,478 --> 08:08:00,798
is usually works in 99 something percent

869
08:08:00,798 --> 08:08:05,520
like i'm making up statistics here in most cases hot reload works in that it

870
08:08:05,520 --> 08:08:10,878
can show you your latest changes however sometimes your changes may be so drastic

871
08:08:10,878 --> 08:08:14,478
and so big and the the

872
08:08:14,478 --> 08:08:17,520
calculation of the delta from the previous previous state to the next to

873
08:08:17,520 --> 08:08:22,000
the new state may be so big that flutter isn't able to do that so then you will

874
08:08:22,000 --> 08:08:25,600
have to do hot reload and then hot reload is

875
08:08:25,600 --> 08:08:30,080
here sorry hot restart you will have to do a hot restart sorry about that

876
08:08:30,080 --> 08:08:35,200
so there's more differences between them like internally about the state

877
08:08:35,200 --> 08:08:38,558
like the state of your application and whether one

878
08:08:38,558 --> 08:08:42,080
keeps your state and the other one loses your state so i'm not going to talk

879
08:08:42,080 --> 08:08:47,120
about that right now because we haven't even talked about states in flutter so i

880
08:08:47,120 --> 08:08:51,200
don't think it makes so much sense to talk about that right now just know that

881
08:08:51,200 --> 08:08:56,638
in most cases hot reload displays your latest changes and that and it's

882
08:08:56,638 --> 08:09:00,320
sufficient if you just do a command s and save your files

883
08:09:00,320 --> 08:09:05,520
but hot restart it will basically kind of like rebuild your application

884
08:09:05,520 --> 08:09:09,680
with new states okay so i think i think to be honest with you

885
08:09:09,680 --> 08:09:15,120
that's sufficient for now so what we need to do now

886
08:09:15,120 --> 08:09:19,600
is to have a look a little bit about at

887
08:09:19,600 --> 08:09:23,680
restructuring the code that is created for us by default

888
08:09:23,680 --> 08:09:27,360
and as you can see here um i mean we don't really know how these

889
08:09:27,360 --> 08:09:32,638
things work right now um you don't even know like in the

890
08:09:32,638 --> 08:09:37,600
caption i say material app inside run app and home page widget

891
08:09:37,600 --> 08:09:41,360
what does this mean well you don't know that and that's okay

892
08:09:41,360 --> 08:09:45,600
i'm not going to like confuse us right now with too much detail but what you'll

893
08:09:45,600 --> 08:09:50,478
need to know right now is that let's go in here and i'm gonna bring the

894
08:09:50,478 --> 08:09:53,840
logs up what i'm gonna do in here in this build

895
08:09:53,840 --> 08:09:58,638
function of my app just go and type print

896
08:09:58,638 --> 08:10:01,520
building

897
08:10:01,520 --> 08:10:05,600
okay and command s and then you'll see that

898
08:10:05,600 --> 08:10:10,320
printed to the screen so every time i'm pressing command s

899
08:10:10,320 --> 08:10:15,440
this entire application is being built again and there is a little bit of like

900
08:10:15,440 --> 08:10:20,080
a resource hug because

901
08:10:20,080 --> 08:10:23,440
as you can see here material application is the entire

902
08:10:23,440 --> 08:10:28,240
kind of like a scaffolding entire frame of your application including the bar on

903
08:10:28,240 --> 08:10:32,718
top including this white view here and including that badge up there on the top

904
08:10:32,718 --> 08:10:36,080
right it's like you are pretty much building

905
08:10:36,080 --> 08:10:39,360
things that you don't need to build every time you save this file so it's a

906
08:10:39,360 --> 08:10:44,478
little bit of like a a problem of um performance whether you want to do that

907
08:10:44,478 --> 08:10:49,840
or not but in this in this uh course i'm just i'm gonna give you some advice on

908
08:10:49,840 --> 08:10:54,160
how to make your application also run a little bit faster so to do that what we

909
08:10:54,160 --> 08:10:57,680
need to do is just to tell flutter that hey look we don't want to build the

910
08:10:57,680 --> 08:11:02,878
entire app every time or the app structure every time we're

911
08:11:02,878 --> 08:11:06,320
pressing command s to how to hot reload so

912
08:11:06,320 --> 08:11:10,240
your challenge here now is to if i get rid of

913
08:11:10,240 --> 08:11:12,798
this what we need to do now is you can see

914
08:11:12,798 --> 08:11:15,440
here in the main function which is the root

915
08:11:15,440 --> 08:11:18,558
function that flutter calls when it actually runs your application it says

916
08:11:18,558 --> 08:11:22,798
okay i'm running an app called my app and if you look at my app the only thing

917
08:11:22,798 --> 08:11:26,718
it does it actually creates a material app that's all it does so

918
08:11:26,718 --> 08:11:31,440
what you need to do now is to grab this material app so i'm just going to say

919
08:11:31,440 --> 08:11:34,160
command x on mac

920
08:11:34,160 --> 08:11:37,600
or control x i think on windows and linux

921
08:11:37,600 --> 08:11:41,440
grab that and instead of this const my app

922
08:11:41,440 --> 08:11:48,718
paste that in there okay and then kill your my app boom like that

923
08:11:48,718 --> 08:11:52,638
okay and then do command s and just to make sure everything is

924
08:11:52,638 --> 08:11:56,398
working correctly i'm just going to do a hot restart

925
08:11:56,398 --> 08:12:01,920
and you can see everything is working as it should so what we did here really was

926
08:12:01,920 --> 08:12:05,040
actually let's see my homepage yeah that's fine

927
08:12:05,040 --> 08:12:07,520
um yeah so

928
08:12:07,520 --> 08:12:12,320
what we have now is just the main function and something called my

929
08:12:12,320 --> 08:12:20,478
homepage stateful widget all right so get your code also to this state

930
08:12:20,478 --> 08:12:23,680
i'm gonna take in my notes that i've talked about that all right

931
08:12:23,680 --> 08:12:28,798
so the next thing we need to talk about is stateless versus stateful

932
08:12:28,798 --> 08:12:31,920
now state

933
08:12:31,920 --> 08:12:35,360
i mean for me it feels like for me to be able to explain this i need to first

934
08:12:35,360 --> 08:12:40,718
explain what a state is uh let's say in here i press this button

935
08:12:40,718 --> 08:12:44,638
five times okay and then i go and i say oh i want to

936
08:12:44,638 --> 08:12:49,200
change the title of this little label there i'm gonna say you

937
08:12:49,200 --> 08:12:53,760
you've instead of you have or

938
08:12:53,760 --> 08:12:58,478
yeah let's convert this to double quotes because we're putting a single code in

939
08:12:58,478 --> 08:13:01,600
there i'm gonna say you've pushed the button

940
08:13:01,600 --> 08:13:05,120
this many times and i'm gonna say command s or control s in windows and

941
08:13:05,120 --> 08:13:11,120
linux to hot reload hot reload yeah command s okay

942
08:13:11,120 --> 08:13:16,240
and you can see is that you've pushed the button this many times but it kept

943
08:13:16,240 --> 08:13:20,558
the number five so if it rebuilt this application or

944
08:13:20,558 --> 08:13:24,160
this widget or this thing that you can see on the

945
08:13:24,160 --> 08:13:29,200
screen how did it keep keep the state well that is because

946
08:13:29,200 --> 08:13:33,920
hot reload is able to sometimes as i mentioned before keep your state and

947
08:13:33,920 --> 08:13:40,798
state is just data data usually mutated and created either by the

948
08:13:40,798 --> 08:13:44,958
application or the user or both and in this case this is a state that the user

949
08:13:44,958 --> 08:13:49,040
is controlling so by pressing the button he or she is increasing this number now

950
08:13:49,040 --> 08:13:54,718
it's 10 okay a state full widget it can keep that

951
08:13:54,718 --> 08:13:56,958
information so

952
08:13:56,958 --> 08:14:00,718
it you see it has something called a counter

953
08:14:00,718 --> 08:14:05,680
it's an integer and it keeps hold of that number so

954
08:14:05,680 --> 08:14:11,600
and upon this number being changed it can kind of redraw itself so

955
08:14:11,600 --> 08:14:15,760
stateful widget is something that is on the screen usually

956
08:14:15,760 --> 08:14:20,320
something that you can visibly see such as this screen the white screen you

957
08:14:20,320 --> 08:14:22,878
can see here stateful

958
08:14:22,878 --> 08:14:30,798
and it can contain data upon who's changing it can redraw itself

959
08:14:30,798 --> 08:14:35,040
itself so had we had the same widget as you can

960
08:14:35,040 --> 08:14:39,840
see in my home page and it was stateless widget which is available as well

961
08:14:39,840 --> 08:14:42,398
you see let's switch it

962
08:14:42,398 --> 08:14:49,920
it wouldn't necessarily be able to redraw itself or contain any mutable

963
08:14:49,920 --> 08:14:56,080
data i mean even stateless widgets for those who are a bit more familiar

964
08:14:56,080 --> 08:15:01,760
with flutter you'll have like value not notifier and builders so even stateless

965
08:15:01,760 --> 08:15:05,200
widgets can be redrawn depending on what you're trying to do

966
08:15:05,200 --> 08:15:11,200
but they cannot contain mutable variables so that is kind of

967
08:15:11,200 --> 08:15:14,318
like the um difference between stateful and

968
08:15:14,318 --> 08:15:19,360
stateless so you can see here this is a variable that is not read-only otherwise

969
08:15:19,360 --> 08:15:23,280
it would be final so if i make this final you can see it says oh you can't

970
08:15:23,280 --> 08:15:27,760
reassign this value to something else so just know that if you see state full

971
08:15:27,760 --> 08:15:32,718
widget then it is a widget that contains information that can be

972
08:15:32,718 --> 08:15:35,840
changed as the user interacts with the widget or

973
08:15:35,840 --> 08:15:41,360
as time goes by or as the widget sees fit however stateless widget is a widget

974
08:15:41,360 --> 08:15:44,798
who's who has who doesn't contain any mutable

975
08:15:44,798 --> 08:15:50,160
pieces of information and doesn't manage any mutable pieces of information

976
08:15:50,160 --> 08:15:54,160
internally okay that's a lot of just just there's a lot

977
08:15:54,160 --> 08:15:57,920
of talk i know if you're not comfortable with like if you if you haven't done

978
08:15:57,920 --> 08:16:01,520
software development before you may not this may not make any sense to you and i

979
08:16:01,520 --> 08:16:04,638
promise you as we go on and of course you're gonna learn more about it so

980
08:16:04,638 --> 08:16:07,360
don't worry about it if you didn't get this

981
08:16:07,360 --> 08:16:10,240
on the get-go

982
08:16:10,240 --> 08:16:13,120
so

983
08:16:13,120 --> 08:16:18,878
you can see now let's see um let's talk a little bit about i'm gonna

984
08:16:18,878 --> 08:16:23,040
actually tick this

985
08:16:23,040 --> 08:16:30,160
in the in my in my notes

986
08:16:30,160 --> 08:16:35,120
okay so i can see in my notes that i had um

987
08:16:35,120 --> 08:16:40,000
that as part of as part of uh what i was going to explain here i was

988
08:16:40,000 --> 08:16:44,000
actually i had planned i can see my notes i had

989
08:16:44,000 --> 08:16:48,798
planned in one of the previous captions uh here um

990
08:16:48,798 --> 08:16:52,398
as part of this caption i was actually supposed to come completely kill this my

991
08:16:52,398 --> 08:16:57,200
home page uh widget and i was supposed to actually create a

992
08:16:57,200 --> 08:17:01,680
widget just called home page so let's do that let's just go back into that

993
08:17:01,680 --> 08:17:06,878
caption so kill this my home page and now

994
08:17:06,878 --> 08:17:13,280
go in here and change this to home page so what we need to do now is to create a

995
08:17:13,280 --> 08:17:18,398
very simple home page okay so i'm gonna remove this title from here as well and

996
08:17:18,398 --> 08:17:22,398
you can see now we have an error telling us that okay i don't know what home page

997
08:17:22,398 --> 08:17:27,840
is now what we need to do is to create a uh actually let me see if i plan to

998
08:17:27,840 --> 08:17:31,520
create a stateless yeah stateless widget okay

999
08:17:31,520 --> 08:17:35,280
a great shortcut that you need to know in visual studio code and i think it may

1000
08:17:35,280 --> 08:17:39,760
be available in android studio as well is if you want to create a stateless

1001
08:17:39,760 --> 08:17:43,840
widget just type stl and you can see it tells you that okay

1002
08:17:43,840 --> 08:17:46,638
you want to create a stateless widget great

1003
08:17:46,638 --> 08:17:51,760
okay there it is then you give it the name of home page okay so now you have a

1004
08:17:51,760 --> 08:17:56,318
home page great and i'm going to do a command s and now you can see this is

1005
08:17:56,318 --> 08:17:59,280
one of the times that flutter was like okay

1006
08:17:59,280 --> 08:18:02,240
i don't understand what you're trying to do you change some stuff in this main

1007
08:18:02,240 --> 08:18:06,638
function and i can't do hot reload so you have to do hot restart so now the

1008
08:18:06,638 --> 08:18:10,000
screen is kind of gonna be black so

1009
08:18:10,000 --> 08:18:14,398
now we have what i had planned in the course initially for for this chapter so

1010
08:18:14,398 --> 08:18:19,200
great let's go now to the next point um

1011
08:18:19,200 --> 08:18:23,040
so you can see the screen is black here and that's because of this container

1012
08:18:23,040 --> 08:18:25,920
there is a little container there or something on the screen that you can't

1013
08:18:25,920 --> 08:18:29,920
really see because it's just black so you could go in here and say there is a

1014
08:18:29,920 --> 08:18:34,000
color and you can say colors red i just command s

1015
08:18:34,000 --> 08:18:37,360
and you can see now the screen is red so just know that there is something on the

1016
08:18:37,360 --> 08:18:41,040
screen but you just can't see it because it's all black so

1017
08:18:41,040 --> 08:18:45,040
the way to get your application to a point that is actually like presentable

1018
08:18:45,040 --> 08:18:49,520
to a user you usually have to create something called a scaffold now scaffold

1019
08:18:49,520 --> 08:18:54,318
as it as its name indicates it's kind of just like the basic building structures

1020
08:18:54,318 --> 08:18:58,798
of an application that kind of makes it presentable to a user to an average user

1021
08:18:58,798 --> 08:19:00,958
so even though if you're creating like a

1022
08:19:00,958 --> 08:19:05,520
graphically intensive application this black background may be completely okay

1023
08:19:05,520 --> 08:19:10,080
but in most applications when you run them then you'll get

1024
08:19:10,080 --> 08:19:13,680
then you'll get like a bar on top that tells you like the name of the screen

1025
08:19:13,680 --> 08:19:17,600
that you're on kind of like the title of a web page and you'll also get some like

1026
08:19:17,600 --> 08:19:22,000
a status bar on top where as you can see here the status bar is kind of like

1027
08:19:22,000 --> 08:19:27,040
black with all white icons on top and it will give you like a wide screen where

1028
08:19:27,040 --> 08:19:31,280
you can interact with your content so we don't have that and in order to

1029
08:19:31,280 --> 08:19:34,558
create that you have to create something called a scaffold so

1030
08:19:34,558 --> 08:19:38,798
go to your container here and say scaffold okay

1031
08:19:38,798 --> 08:19:43,280
now i'm gonna press command s and you'll see all this on then we get this little

1032
08:19:43,280 --> 08:19:47,680
white screen here and then there's a little tint on our status bar as well so

1033
08:19:47,680 --> 08:19:50,798
it makes it a little bit more presentable okay

1034
08:19:50,798 --> 08:19:54,080
so what we need to do now i'll basically

1035
08:19:54,080 --> 08:19:59,600
see if i've planned to add some bar title in here which i haven't so let's

1036
08:19:59,600 --> 08:20:04,318
do that right now so for our scaffold we're also going to add an is something

1037
08:20:04,318 --> 08:20:09,280
called an app bar so go to your scaffold and say app bar

1038
08:20:09,280 --> 08:20:14,718
and then say i create a new instance of the app bar class all right

1039
08:20:14,718 --> 08:20:20,000
and in here there's a property called title and as the title say text

1040
08:20:20,000 --> 08:20:22,478
okay and for the text i'm going to get rid of

1041
08:20:22,478 --> 08:20:25,440
all this documentation there's excessive amount of documentation here which kind

1042
08:20:25,440 --> 08:20:30,080
of blocks the screen so and for the text just say

1043
08:20:30,080 --> 08:20:33,600
register for instance and make it a constant

1044
08:20:33,600 --> 08:20:39,200
so and put a comma here and a uh comma here as well

1045
08:20:39,200 --> 08:20:43,920
so you see after you've done that your screen has a beautiful blue bar

1046
08:20:43,920 --> 08:20:47,920
here with the title of your uh application or the title of your home

1047
08:20:47,920 --> 08:20:51,440
page and there is a white canvas here for the

1048
08:20:51,440 --> 08:20:56,478
rest of your content to be displayed so now there are a few things in here which

1049
08:20:56,478 --> 08:20:59,840
i could jump over but i kind of feel like they're so important to explain

1050
08:20:59,840 --> 08:21:04,478
that i'm going to do that right now so in flutter every time you have for

1051
08:21:04,478 --> 08:21:08,958
instance here there is a text you see sorry there is an app bar an app bar if

1052
08:21:08,958 --> 08:21:13,120
you go into the source code of an app bar let's go a little bit higher you can

1053
08:21:13,120 --> 08:21:18,638
see it it says i'm a stateful widget all right so app bar in itself is a widget

1054
08:21:18,638 --> 08:21:22,240
so what we're doing here is saying we have something called a scaffold let's

1055
08:21:22,240 --> 08:21:26,798
go to scaffold it itself is a stateful widget so we're saying the main widget

1056
08:21:26,798 --> 08:21:30,160
we're returning from our build function as you can see it should return a widget

1057
08:21:30,160 --> 08:21:34,398
is a scaffold which is a stateful widget in itself it has a property called app

1058
08:21:34,398 --> 08:21:38,718
bar an app bar it itself is a stateful widget which in turn has a property

1059
08:21:38,718 --> 08:21:43,280
called title now the title if you look at the documentation it says

1060
08:21:43,280 --> 08:21:46,478
title is also widget so

1061
08:21:46,478 --> 08:21:49,280
let me also make the screen a little bit bigger

1062
08:21:49,280 --> 08:21:52,638
like this so you see it better so

1063
08:21:52,638 --> 08:21:56,240
now the title is a widget and we're saying oh we're going to use a text

1064
08:21:56,240 --> 08:22:00,558
widget if you look at text what it is is a stateless widget it means internally

1065
08:22:00,558 --> 08:22:05,680
it states or its state can change and it it doesn't have any mutable variables

1066
08:22:05,680 --> 08:22:09,840
okay oh i didn't want to change that so

1067
08:22:09,840 --> 08:22:13,760
if you see what we're doing here when in flutter you're just creating widgets

1068
08:22:13,760 --> 08:22:18,318
everywhere in flutter almost everything is a widget either stateful or stateless

1069
08:22:18,318 --> 08:22:22,160
and you try to you need to kind of try to stick to stateless widgets as much as

1070
08:22:22,160 --> 08:22:27,600
you can all right we're going to talk more about stateful and stateless so

1071
08:22:27,600 --> 08:22:31,120
now that we've added the scaffold and i've explained a little bit about these

1072
08:22:31,120 --> 08:22:36,160
widgets that were we've created and we've done a command as here just to

1073
08:22:36,160 --> 08:22:40,080
hot reload the application or this widget

1074
08:22:40,080 --> 08:22:46,318
uh what we need to do next is to create a login button

1075
08:22:46,318 --> 08:22:49,520
so let's go and create some sort of a login

1076
08:22:49,520 --> 08:22:52,478
button and you can see here i've written the

1077
08:22:52,478 --> 08:22:56,160
caption button on home page in the center to log in

1078
08:22:56,160 --> 08:23:01,200
or more accurately it could actually be register

1079
08:23:01,200 --> 08:23:05,440
so i'm going to change that i'm going to say register button

1080
08:23:05,440 --> 08:23:09,440
and button on the homepage in the center to register okay

1081
08:23:09,440 --> 08:23:14,000
display the caption to you there to and i'm gonna change my notes here

1082
08:23:14,000 --> 08:23:18,878
just quickly all right so now your task is to create a button on

1083
08:23:18,878 --> 08:23:23,280
the screen how do you do that well in scaffold you see the scaffold at the

1084
08:23:23,280 --> 08:23:27,440
moment it's the owner of that bar on top and it's the owner of this

1085
08:23:27,440 --> 08:23:31,440
white content here so what you need to do is to go and look at a property

1086
08:23:31,440 --> 08:23:34,798
called body and body is

1087
08:23:34,798 --> 08:23:39,600
in itself if i move my mouse over it says okay give me a widget you see

1088
08:23:39,600 --> 08:23:44,478
and of course i could say well i have no widgets null is also acceptable but in

1089
08:23:44,478 --> 08:23:50,240
this case we're going to create a button called text button so text button is a

1090
08:23:50,240 --> 08:23:53,920
widget if you go into source code you'll see it's a

1091
08:23:53,920 --> 08:23:59,280
text button button style button and that is a state full widget all right so

1092
08:23:59,280 --> 08:24:02,558
you're basically saying that i'm creating a button and i want to allow

1093
08:24:02,558 --> 08:24:06,638
the user to do something with it all right so we need to do as you can see

1094
08:24:06,638 --> 08:24:10,878
there is a little bit of an error here to say that says unpressed is a

1095
08:24:10,878 --> 08:24:15,440
parameter that you haven't provided to me so we need to tell this button

1096
08:24:15,440 --> 08:24:20,160
that when this button is pressed it needs to

1097
08:24:20,160 --> 08:24:24,080
do something and this is a requirement for the text button class that it's

1098
08:24:24,080 --> 08:24:28,398
telling you well i'm a button what do you want me to do when i'm

1099
08:24:28,398 --> 08:24:33,040
pressed if you don't press if you don't provide unpressed parameter to me i

1100
08:24:33,040 --> 08:24:37,040
don't i'm not even a button i could just be a label and that is what this error

1101
08:24:37,040 --> 08:24:39,840
is all about is saying that if you're creating a button make sure that you

1102
08:24:39,840 --> 08:24:43,440
handle what happens when the user presses on so

1103
08:24:43,440 --> 08:24:48,398
in here just type unpressed and i'm just going to get visual studio

1104
08:24:48,398 --> 08:24:54,240
to complete this code for me you can see it says okay an empty function

1105
08:24:54,240 --> 08:24:57,680
a function with empty list of parameters so no parameters

1106
08:24:57,680 --> 08:25:01,120
and then the code in itself is empty at the

1107
08:25:01,120 --> 08:25:06,240
moment okay so go after the create creation of that function and then you

1108
08:25:06,240 --> 08:25:09,840
see that there is another that you have to handle that says child

1109
08:25:09,840 --> 08:25:13,360
you see text button you would say you would probably just assume that oh a

1110
08:25:13,360 --> 08:25:17,840
text button should have some sort of a string parameter that says what is my

1111
08:25:17,840 --> 08:25:19,680
text so

1112
08:25:19,680 --> 08:25:24,080
if we write child here the beauty of flutter is that it says

1113
08:25:24,080 --> 08:25:30,318
child is a widget so text button doesn't doesn't make any assumptions about what

1114
08:25:30,318 --> 08:25:33,120
content you want to display on that button

1115
08:25:33,120 --> 08:25:37,440
what it does it says i need to display some widget anything it could be an

1116
08:25:37,440 --> 08:25:41,440
image it could be an icon it could be whatever it could be a list of things

1117
08:25:41,440 --> 08:25:45,040
which is not a good idea to do but you could still do that so

1118
08:25:45,040 --> 08:25:48,398
um go and create a child widget and now

1119
08:25:48,398 --> 08:25:51,680
you've learned about the text widget so i'm just gonna say a constant text

1120
08:25:51,680 --> 08:25:55,680
widget and in here we're just going to say register okay

1121
08:25:55,680 --> 08:25:58,958
now command s and you'll see now all of a sudden you

1122
08:25:58,958 --> 08:26:03,120
have a register button there so another cool feature now i want to

1123
08:26:03,120 --> 08:26:05,920
show you in visual studio and i think it's available also in android stu is

1124
08:26:05,920 --> 08:26:11,280
that you can go and wrap your widgets with other widgets so instead of for

1125
08:26:11,280 --> 08:26:15,680
instance saying that i want the text button to be in the center and then you

1126
08:26:15,680 --> 08:26:20,878
go and create a center if you know it also exists you could do

1127
08:26:20,878 --> 08:26:25,200
command dot or command dot on mac or control dot in windows and linux and

1128
08:26:25,200 --> 08:26:29,440
visual studio code on the widget that you want to wrap in some other widget

1129
08:26:29,440 --> 08:26:32,958
and then you will get this beautiful menu that

1130
08:26:32,958 --> 08:26:36,638
says you you know you can wrap it with many different things so i'm just going

1131
08:26:36,638 --> 08:26:42,000
to pronounce a wrap with center so as you can see center is a widget that has

1132
08:26:42,000 --> 08:26:47,840
a child property all center does is that it tries to center

1133
08:26:47,840 --> 08:26:55,280
horizontally and vertically it's child inside the available space of the center

1134
08:26:55,280 --> 08:26:58,878
widget itself the entire available space in this case

1135
08:26:58,878 --> 08:27:04,398
as you can see is this entire white background so center has access to that

1136
08:27:04,398 --> 08:27:09,680
entire white background right now because center is the root widget of our

1137
08:27:09,680 --> 08:27:14,638
body which is the only thing that our scaffold is showing at the moment

1138
08:27:14,638 --> 08:27:18,160
so center then is able to center align this

1139
08:27:18,160 --> 08:27:22,798
text button so let's command s and you can see the register button is centered

1140
08:27:22,798 --> 08:27:27,280
horizontally and vertically in the available space

1141
08:27:27,280 --> 08:27:32,318
now that i've talked about that i'm going to take it here

1142
08:27:32,318 --> 08:27:37,760
and what we're going to do here is very very important so

1143
08:27:37,760 --> 08:27:42,718
what we need to do is we now need to handle when the text

1144
08:27:42,718 --> 08:27:47,120
button is pressed that we're going register a user with

1145
08:27:47,120 --> 08:27:49,520
firebase okay now

1146
08:27:49,520 --> 08:27:54,240
we talked about this when i talked about like uh dart in the previous chapters we

1147
08:27:54,240 --> 08:27:57,280
talked about synchronous and asynchronous and i'm not gonna go into

1148
08:27:57,280 --> 08:28:01,280
details about that now registration i'm sorry i'm not going to

1149
08:28:01,280 --> 08:28:05,440
talk about that in details because we've talked about that in details before so

1150
08:28:05,440 --> 08:28:09,360
if you need to know about that i think synchronous and asynchronous were

1151
08:28:09,360 --> 08:28:14,558
probably explained in um i'll have a look at my notes

1152
08:28:14,558 --> 08:28:19,520
they were explained in chapter number seven so if you haven't watched chapter

1153
08:28:19,520 --> 08:28:22,958
number seven i strongly suggest that you do that if you don't know what sync and

1154
08:28:22,958 --> 08:28:25,600
async are um

1155
08:28:25,600 --> 08:28:28,878
what we need to do now is to tell firebase to register user now

1156
08:28:28,878 --> 08:28:33,040
registering a user with firebase is an asynchronous task so it's not going to

1157
08:28:33,040 --> 08:28:38,160
complete immediately so what we need to do now is to tell flutter that the

1158
08:28:38,160 --> 08:28:42,958
button press is an asynchronous task and all you need to do here is just to put

1159
08:28:42,958 --> 08:28:48,160
the keyword async in there okay so

1160
08:28:48,160 --> 08:28:52,160
that is that that's it in my

1161
08:28:52,160 --> 08:28:57,440
notes i've talked about it

1162
08:28:57,440 --> 08:29:01,440
now what we need to do is to have a look at

1163
08:29:01,440 --> 08:29:08,080
this link that i've provided for you um i'm going to close this safari window

1164
08:29:08,080 --> 08:29:13,600
let me see if i can show you on this screen

1165
08:29:13,600 --> 08:29:16,080
um

1166
08:29:16,080 --> 08:29:22,318
other sign-in methods great you can see as i'm displaying here

1167
08:29:22,318 --> 08:29:28,080
firebase allows you to enable various sign-in methods

1168
08:29:28,080 --> 08:29:32,240
uh to your for your users so um

1169
08:29:32,240 --> 08:29:35,440
firebase is not only limited to like google

1170
08:29:35,440 --> 08:29:40,160
services you can as you can see it can allow you to enable facebook signing for

1171
08:29:40,160 --> 08:29:45,360
users or apple sign-in twitter or phone number sign-in so there

1172
08:29:45,360 --> 08:29:50,478
are various methods available for you to enable in your flutter

1173
08:29:50,478 --> 08:29:54,718
application and in this application we're gonna use email and password sign

1174
08:29:54,718 --> 08:29:57,680
in and there's like documentation about all

1175
08:29:57,680 --> 08:30:02,080
of those in this link that i've provided provided to you so

1176
08:30:02,080 --> 08:30:05,360
i'm not gonna go through the entire contents of this to be honest with you

1177
08:30:05,360 --> 08:30:09,280
because there are just so much information and we're not interested in

1178
08:30:09,280 --> 08:30:13,120
all of these but still i believe if you're interested in firebase and

1179
08:30:13,120 --> 08:30:18,398
firebase authentication which we are going to use in this course it is great

1180
08:30:18,398 --> 08:30:24,638
if you could just have a look at this link that i provided for you here

1181
08:30:24,638 --> 08:30:28,160
so what we need to do now

1182
08:30:28,160 --> 08:30:32,160
is also right i've written here that i need to talk about a little bit about

1183
08:30:32,160 --> 08:30:37,280
anonymous users you see firebase when you start your application and you kick

1184
08:30:37,280 --> 08:30:41,600
firebait if firebase you basically start the whole process of

1185
08:30:41,600 --> 08:30:46,240
firebase you say firebase start firebase is amazing in that on the

1186
08:30:46,240 --> 08:30:50,958
client side it by default creates something called an anonymous user so if

1187
08:30:50,958 --> 08:30:54,080
you talk with firebase with your thoughts or application and say who's

1188
08:30:54,080 --> 08:30:57,600
the current user even if you haven't done anything with firebase before if

1189
08:30:57,600 --> 08:31:00,798
you haven't configured it or actually you have to configure it

1190
08:31:00,798 --> 08:31:05,520
which we have already done but if you haven't called any firebase functions

1191
08:31:05,520 --> 08:31:09,360
before in your application you could just say firebase who's the current user

1192
08:31:09,360 --> 08:31:13,440
and firebase will just tell you here's a current user it's an anonymous user so

1193
08:31:13,440 --> 08:31:17,120
that user is pretty much never going to be empty it's never going to be null or

1194
08:31:17,120 --> 08:31:21,760
nil or whatever you like to call it so or if you're python developer you just

1195
08:31:21,760 --> 08:31:25,520
call it none so that user is almost never none

1196
08:31:25,520 --> 08:31:30,478
so just know that firebase has a concept of anonymous users okay

1197
08:31:30,478 --> 08:31:33,840
i'm just going to take that in my notes that we've talked about it

1198
08:31:33,840 --> 08:31:37,360
so what we need to do in the next step i'm going to bring the caption up so we

1199
08:31:37,360 --> 08:31:40,638
have to kind of like speed things up a little bit here because there's so much

1200
08:31:40,638 --> 08:31:43,760
to talk about um what we need to do here now is just

1201
08:31:43,760 --> 08:31:47,120
to create two text fields now one for the

1202
08:31:47,120 --> 08:31:52,240
email and the other one for the password and we are going to then put our button

1203
08:31:52,240 --> 08:31:56,160
um next to those two text fields so text

1204
08:31:56,160 --> 08:32:00,478
field one email text field 2 password and then the register button as the

1205
08:32:00,478 --> 08:32:04,398
third component now if you have components like this that you want to

1206
08:32:04,398 --> 08:32:09,360
stack vertically one on top of each other and one after each other then you

1207
08:32:09,360 --> 08:32:12,798
need to use a which is called column all right

1208
08:32:12,798 --> 08:32:17,440
so what i'm going to do here is go here to the center and kind of like remove

1209
08:32:17,440 --> 08:32:20,798
that i'm just going to say command dot in mac or control dot in windows on

1210
08:32:20,798 --> 08:32:25,280
linux and just say remove this widget okay i don't want to center anymore

1211
08:32:25,280 --> 08:32:30,160
command s results register buttons on top left and what i'm going to do is i'm

1212
08:32:30,160 --> 08:32:34,718
going to command up again and say wrap with column okay now if you command s

1213
08:32:34,718 --> 08:32:38,878
you'll not see anything directly on the screen no changes all right

1214
08:32:38,878 --> 08:32:44,240
but what was created for you is a column widget with children property which is a

1215
08:32:44,240 --> 08:32:48,398
list of widgets that it can display so the first thing we're gonna do is to

1216
08:32:48,398 --> 08:32:52,958
create two text fields okay so let me have a look here and just make

1217
08:32:52,958 --> 08:32:57,120
sure yeah i'm just going to say a text field

1218
08:32:57,120 --> 08:33:02,240
and another text field okay like that

1219
08:33:02,240 --> 08:33:05,920
save you'll see two text fields display there so i can actually go in there and

1220
08:33:05,920 --> 08:33:11,840
start typing something okay like that so now we've created two text

1221
08:33:11,840 --> 08:33:16,878
fields with a column on the screen

1222
08:33:16,878 --> 08:33:20,638
i'm going to note that here a ticket in my notes so we've talked about it now

1223
08:33:20,638 --> 08:33:25,680
what we need to do is grab the text that is displayed in this

1224
08:33:25,680 --> 08:33:29,680
take these text fields and when you press the register button pass that to

1225
08:33:29,680 --> 08:33:33,200
firebase okay now you see i'm telling you that when you press the button you

1226
08:33:33,200 --> 08:33:37,520
need to grab the text inside these text fields but inside this function of

1227
08:33:37,520 --> 08:33:42,478
onpress you have no access to these text fields okay so you kind of need to pass

1228
08:33:42,478 --> 08:33:47,840
information from this text field and this text field to a text button and the

1229
08:33:47,840 --> 08:33:53,120
way to do that is is using something called a text controller

1230
08:33:53,120 --> 08:33:56,958
so a text or a text editing controller a

1231
08:33:56,958 --> 08:34:00,798
text editing controller is kind of like a proxy object that you pass

1232
08:34:00,798 --> 08:34:05,520
to your text field and the text field it writes its current text all the time to

1233
08:34:05,520 --> 08:34:10,080
that text editing controller and in your text button here then you can say

1234
08:34:10,080 --> 08:34:14,958
controller text okay so you can then so it's kind of like if your text field is

1235
08:34:14,958 --> 08:34:18,160
sitting here and your text button is sitting here then you'll have something

1236
08:34:18,160 --> 08:34:22,798
here in the middle that is your proxy the text editing controller that is

1237
08:34:22,798 --> 08:34:27,360
grabbing me for latest information from the text field and then your the text

1238
08:34:27,360 --> 08:34:30,638
button can read that information okay so just know that a text editing controller

1239
08:34:30,638 --> 08:34:35,360
is kind of like a proxy now that we need to manage some state we

1240
08:34:35,360 --> 08:34:39,280
need to manage this proxy object then we need to convert our home page to a

1241
08:34:39,280 --> 08:34:44,080
stateful widget okay so go in here to your home page command dot and say

1242
08:34:44,080 --> 08:34:47,760
convert to stateful widgets so all of a sudden stateful widget all right

1243
08:34:47,760 --> 08:34:53,200
so um now what we need to do is to go and

1244
08:34:53,200 --> 08:34:57,120
create those two text editing controllers so i'm going to go in here

1245
08:34:57,120 --> 08:35:01,120
go to your home page state here and say

1246
08:35:01,120 --> 08:35:05,040
late final what do we call them do i have any

1247
08:35:05,040 --> 08:35:09,600
specific desire here let me see my notes

1248
08:35:09,600 --> 08:35:12,478
no so there's no desire really for the

1249
08:35:12,478 --> 08:35:16,958
naming so let's just say late final text thing

1250
08:35:16,958 --> 08:35:21,280
controller and let's call it here email okay

1251
08:35:21,280 --> 08:35:25,120
and the other one i'm just gonna say password

1252
08:35:25,120 --> 08:35:29,120
now in the previous chapters we haven't talked about late what late is this

1253
08:35:29,120 --> 08:35:34,318
keyword in dark that tells your program that although this print although this

1254
08:35:34,318 --> 08:35:39,680
variable has no value right now but i promise to assign a value to it before

1255
08:35:39,680 --> 08:35:44,000
it is used so it's kind of like a it's a contract so

1256
08:35:44,000 --> 08:35:48,160
late literally means that i'm not ready right now i will do it later i'm not

1257
08:35:48,160 --> 08:35:53,120
ready to assign a value to this so what we need to do now is to

1258
08:35:53,120 --> 08:35:56,958
um is to create these values now

1259
08:35:56,958 --> 08:36:00,478
you need to also know something about stateful widgets now that our homepage

1260
08:36:00,478 --> 08:36:04,000
state is a stateful widget it will have two amazing

1261
08:36:04,000 --> 08:36:09,040
amazing two great functions one is called init state i

1262
08:36:09,040 --> 08:36:13,760
believe and the other one called is disposed now init state is a function

1263
08:36:13,760 --> 08:36:17,760
that will be called by flutter automatically when it creates your home

1264
08:36:17,760 --> 08:36:23,040
page so it says okay now you have the ability to create all your variables or

1265
08:36:23,040 --> 08:36:25,520
your late variables once

1266
08:36:25,520 --> 08:36:29,920
now whenever this homepage then dies and goes out of the memory or it's trying to

1267
08:36:29,920 --> 08:36:33,840
go out the memory it will also get a function called dispose

1268
08:36:33,840 --> 08:36:36,958
so you've said that in the contract i've

1269
08:36:36,958 --> 08:36:39,760
written that i'm going to provide a value for these emails email and

1270
08:36:39,760 --> 08:36:43,520
password text editing controllers and the best way to do that is to go into

1271
08:36:43,520 --> 08:36:47,120
this init state function here

1272
08:36:47,120 --> 08:36:50,878
and assign those to proper values so i'm

1273
08:36:50,878 --> 08:36:56,240
just gonna say email email is text editing controller like

1274
08:36:56,240 --> 08:36:58,878
that okay

1275
08:36:58,878 --> 08:37:02,718
and i'm gonna do the same thing for the password field

1276
08:37:02,718 --> 08:37:07,600
now you also need to understand that you after you've created these two you also

1277
08:37:07,600 --> 08:37:13,280
need to dispose of them all right so go in and overwrite your dispose

1278
08:37:13,280 --> 08:37:19,920
function and then say email dispose and password

1279
08:37:19,920 --> 08:37:24,160
so a lot of developers forget to do this especially like newcomers so don't make

1280
08:37:24,160 --> 08:37:28,638
that mistake so you created the text editing controllers and you're also in

1281
08:37:28,638 --> 08:37:35,360
charge of disposing them okay now um

1282
08:37:35,360 --> 08:37:40,318
okay uh so we've done that already after you've created your text editing

1283
08:37:40,318 --> 08:37:43,520
controllers you need to go to your text fields and assign

1284
08:37:43,520 --> 08:37:46,958
those controllers to your text field so in here there's a parameter called

1285
08:37:46,958 --> 08:37:52,000
controller and just say email and for your text field on the second

1286
08:37:52,000 --> 08:37:55,600
one which is for your password say controller

1287
08:37:55,600 --> 08:38:00,558
it's password so what is happening now is you hooked this proxy object that sat

1288
08:38:00,558 --> 08:38:03,760
here this one which is your email or password

1289
08:38:03,760 --> 08:38:07,040
text editing controller to your text field that is sitting here okay you

1290
08:38:07,040 --> 08:38:10,478
still haven't hooked it to your text button which is sitting here so this

1291
08:38:10,478 --> 08:38:14,478
link is kind of broken and we're gonna fix that soon

1292
08:38:14,478 --> 08:38:19,040
okay take it in the notes that we've talked about that

1293
08:38:19,040 --> 08:38:22,718
so what we need to do now at the moment if i press command s you will see no

1294
08:38:22,718 --> 08:38:26,080
visible changes on the screen however there's a little bit of a problem with

1295
08:38:26,080 --> 08:38:29,520
our text fields as you can see they don't have any hint they don't tell the

1296
08:38:29,520 --> 08:38:34,240
user what they expect the user to actually enter so

1297
08:38:34,240 --> 08:38:37,760
what we need to do now is to go and add something to these text fields called a

1298
08:38:37,760 --> 08:38:40,558
hint a hint is a piece of information

1299
08:38:40,558 --> 08:38:45,280
provided to the user and usually kind of like very subtle

1300
08:38:45,280 --> 08:38:49,520
color that tells the user about the information that this text field expects

1301
08:38:49,520 --> 08:38:52,798
them to enter and that hint will automatically be

1302
08:38:52,798 --> 08:38:58,318
removed as soon as the user types at least one character on that text field

1303
08:38:58,318 --> 08:39:01,920
okay so let's go to the first text field and say

1304
08:39:01,920 --> 08:39:06,000
decoration and i believe it's an input decoration

1305
08:39:06,000 --> 08:39:11,280
and then say input decoration okay and for the hint there's so much

1306
08:39:11,280 --> 08:39:13,840
information on the screen we can't see anything

1307
08:39:13,840 --> 08:39:19,680
and there is a hint text as you can see hints text and it expects a string so in

1308
08:39:19,680 --> 08:39:26,160
here say please enter or just say enter your email here

1309
08:39:26,160 --> 08:39:29,280
and you can see it's suggesting this to be a constant so i'm going to make it a

1310
08:39:29,280 --> 08:39:32,558
constant and a little bit of a comma there as

1311
08:39:32,558 --> 08:39:35,680
well and you can see now it says enter your email here

1312
08:39:35,680 --> 08:39:40,478
and copy and paste this decoration as well and put it in the next text field

1313
08:39:40,478 --> 08:39:46,160
so say that enter your password here

1314
08:39:46,160 --> 08:39:50,080
so let's enter your email here enter your password here

1315
08:39:50,080 --> 08:39:52,478
so um

1316
08:39:52,478 --> 08:39:56,638
let me also make sure that that is correct there and take it in the box so

1317
08:39:56,638 --> 08:39:59,360
um then if you start typing in those fields

1318
08:39:59,360 --> 08:40:02,398
you can see that the hints disappears as soon as you type something and if you

1319
08:40:02,398 --> 08:40:06,240
remove that character then the hint also disappears and the same thing for the

1320
08:40:06,240 --> 08:40:11,920
password okay so we've now got the

1321
08:40:11,920 --> 08:40:16,318
groundwork like the base work done here and we need to get

1322
08:40:16,318 --> 08:40:20,478
through the authentication so when you press this text button here where we

1323
08:40:20,478 --> 08:40:24,798
need to do authentication and that means we're just going to register for now

1324
08:40:24,798 --> 08:40:27,840
so what you need to do is you need to import

1325
08:40:27,840 --> 08:40:32,638
firebase so firebase was our dependency and using the import statement you can

1326
08:40:32,638 --> 08:40:36,398
actually grab the content that it was created for firebase and bring it into

1327
08:40:36,398 --> 08:40:40,478
your source code okay so as you can see here we're gonna bring

1328
08:40:40,478 --> 08:40:46,798
package uh firebase off and firebase off parts okay

1329
08:40:46,798 --> 08:40:50,160
now command s you don't see any difference on the screen because an

1330
08:40:50,160 --> 08:40:55,040
import statement doesn't really change the state of your application as such

1331
08:40:55,040 --> 08:40:58,958
and after the importing

1332
08:40:58,958 --> 08:41:01,600
we need to i'm going to take it here as well that

1333
08:41:01,600 --> 08:41:05,440
we've talked about it so what we need to do now is to upon

1334
08:41:05,440 --> 08:41:09,920
pressing this button where we're going to get your

1335
08:41:09,920 --> 08:41:14,798
username and password from these text fields so let's say final

1336
08:41:14,798 --> 08:41:19,920
username or sorry email and i'm going to say the email field text

1337
08:41:19,920 --> 08:41:24,718
i'm going to say final password is password

1338
08:41:24,718 --> 08:41:28,080
text we're going to our email and password

1339
08:41:28,080 --> 08:41:32,478
controllers and grabbing their text which is the latest text that the user

1340
08:41:32,478 --> 08:41:35,600
entered in those fields okay so

1341
08:41:35,600 --> 08:41:39,520
after we've done that now you can go and say firebase

1342
08:41:39,520 --> 08:41:44,398
auth instance

1343
08:41:44,398 --> 08:41:48,958
and then you will say create user with email and password you can see this is a

1344
08:41:48,958 --> 08:41:52,080
function that allows you to register or create a

1345
08:41:52,080 --> 08:41:56,318
user as its name indicates uh with firebase so

1346
08:41:56,318 --> 08:42:01,760
um i'm gonna do that so as you can see here as well this thing returns a future

1347
08:42:01,760 --> 08:42:05,440
okay so um

1348
08:42:05,440 --> 08:42:10,878
so this is this is not nothing that you can just like call and say hey do this

1349
08:42:10,878 --> 08:42:12,798
now um

1350
08:42:12,798 --> 08:42:17,440
without actually awaiting on it otherwise it will just say here i am a

1351
08:42:17,440 --> 08:42:21,280
future i'm something that i will calculate something in the future and

1352
08:42:21,280 --> 08:42:25,920
by not putting a weight before that call you will only get the instance of future

1353
08:42:25,920 --> 08:42:30,160
you will not actually get the work that it's doing you will get like a wrapper

1354
08:42:30,160 --> 08:42:33,520
around the work saying that this is the kind of work i'm gonna do but if you

1355
08:42:33,520 --> 08:42:37,520
have weight on it it will actually perform the work

1356
08:42:37,520 --> 08:42:40,878
if that makes any sense so i've explained the weight in that chapter i

1357
08:42:40,878 --> 08:42:44,878
think also chapter seven or whatever it was when we talked about more advanced

1358
08:42:44,878 --> 08:42:48,798
topics in dart so please have a look at that chapter as well

1359
08:42:48,798 --> 08:42:53,600
um after doing that you will see that the return of this is actually future of

1360
08:42:53,600 --> 08:42:58,080
a user credential so what i'm going to do is i'm going to say final user

1361
08:42:58,080 --> 08:43:02,638
credential is this and then i'm going to print it user

1362
08:43:02,638 --> 08:43:06,558
credential okay so command s

1363
08:43:06,558 --> 08:43:11,280
and just hot restart here just in case because we didn't import so what i'm

1364
08:43:11,280 --> 08:43:16,958
going to do in enter email here i'm going to say pixelityab.gmail.com

1365
08:43:16,958 --> 08:43:20,558
and for the password i'm just going to say fubar

1366
08:43:20,558 --> 08:43:26,240
bass okay so let's bring our console up so we can

1367
08:43:26,240 --> 08:43:29,440
see what our application prints to the screen

1368
08:43:29,440 --> 08:43:33,520
and i'm just going to say register which we're going to get an error for right

1369
08:43:33,520 --> 08:43:39,520
now so and you can see here it says no firebase

1370
08:43:39,520 --> 08:43:44,958
app default has been created called firebase initialize app

1371
08:43:44,958 --> 08:43:47,680
so this is i mean this is really good that

1372
08:43:47,680 --> 08:43:52,398
we're getting this because i actually have planned for us to fix that

1373
08:43:52,398 --> 08:43:59,120
um but before we go ahead and do that um i should probably explain what this

1374
08:43:59,120 --> 08:44:02,878
is why this is happening you see firebase there was there was if you

1375
08:44:02,878 --> 08:44:06,080
remember when we configured it there was a file created here for us called

1376
08:44:06,080 --> 08:44:09,760
firebase options and it has a lot of code in it and then

1377
08:44:09,760 --> 08:44:15,360
there's like a configuration here uh that here you see android and for ios as

1378
08:44:15,360 --> 08:44:18,798
well now what firebase is complaining about is saying that you've created this

1379
08:44:18,798 --> 08:44:22,318
configuration but you've never actually told me about it so

1380
08:44:22,318 --> 08:44:26,558
poor firebase so what we need to do now before we actually do the configuration

1381
08:44:26,558 --> 08:44:29,040
is to fix something that you can immediately see

1382
08:44:29,040 --> 08:44:31,840
on the screen which is which is incorrect

1383
08:44:31,840 --> 08:44:36,478
you see foo bar bas is your password it shouldn't be visible to the user so when

1384
08:44:36,478 --> 08:44:41,040
you're typing it it should be a password field and at the same time this field

1385
08:44:41,040 --> 08:44:45,280
here you see is is an email field but where is the add sign at sign isn't

1386
08:44:45,280 --> 08:44:49,840
immediately visible here so you need to tell these text fields to be configured

1387
08:44:49,840 --> 08:44:54,558
in a specific way so that they're actually suitable for email and password

1388
08:44:54,558 --> 08:44:58,240
registration fields so i'm going to get rid of this bar on

1389
08:44:58,240 --> 08:45:02,558
the right oh sorry on the left and what we need to do is to bring up

1390
08:45:02,558 --> 08:45:06,080
the caption for the next thing for the next topic to

1391
08:45:06,080 --> 08:45:09,600
talk about talk about first what we're going to do is to make

1392
08:45:09,600 --> 08:45:12,638
this password text field

1393
08:45:12,638 --> 08:45:14,798
secure so

1394
08:45:14,798 --> 08:45:18,718
what you need to do here in your decoration of the password field go in

1395
08:45:18,718 --> 08:45:23,840
here and say obscure um actually it's not in the decorations right here

1396
08:45:23,840 --> 08:45:28,318
obscure text it has true and if you press s on that

1397
08:45:28,318 --> 08:45:33,280
you'll see that your text is now obscure also you need to do a

1398
08:45:33,280 --> 08:45:37,680
enable suggestions false and then you will also do

1399
08:45:37,680 --> 08:45:41,120
autocorrect false these are three important

1400
08:45:41,120 --> 08:45:44,558
properties to provide here now you see enable

1401
08:45:44,558 --> 08:45:48,798
suggestions is usually like as you're typing in a text field depending on your

1402
08:45:48,798 --> 08:45:52,080
operating system it will provide you suggestions like

1403
08:45:52,080 --> 08:45:54,958
this in a password field you don't want to do

1404
08:45:54,958 --> 08:45:58,000
that you don't want to have any suggestions so that's for enabled

1405
08:45:58,000 --> 08:46:02,878
suggestions also autocorrect is when you try to type something and you know you

1406
08:46:02,878 --> 08:46:05,600
all probably know what autocorrect is so i'm not going to explain it so you're

1407
08:46:05,600 --> 08:46:08,798
disabling autocorrect based on your password password field which makes

1408
08:46:08,798 --> 08:46:14,160
sense so um now let's go and bring these two properties

1409
08:46:14,160 --> 08:46:18,318
also to our email field which is here

1410
08:46:18,318 --> 08:46:21,680
okay and what we're also going to do is to

1411
08:46:21,680 --> 08:46:27,520
tell it that it is an email it needs an email keyboard so let's go in here and

1412
08:46:27,520 --> 08:46:32,558
say input or keyboard i think type and it's called

1413
08:46:32,558 --> 08:46:36,160
text input type i think

1414
08:46:36,160 --> 08:46:41,120
and then dot email there's the email address so

1415
08:46:41,120 --> 08:46:45,520
save it now if i then go here you can see

1416
08:46:45,520 --> 08:46:51,760
there's an ad sign so i can um oh sorry you can't see it so i'm going to do

1417
08:46:51,760 --> 08:46:55,520
this so you can actually see the that sign so you can see their keyboard here

1418
08:46:55,520 --> 08:46:59,920
and then there's an ad sign right there okay

1419
08:46:59,920 --> 08:47:03,520
so that's for that and then suggestions are

1420
08:47:03,520 --> 08:47:09,280
also disabled so as i type there's no suggestions really for my um text

1421
08:47:09,280 --> 08:47:12,160
because you don't want suggestions on email fields emails are usually like

1422
08:47:12,160 --> 08:47:16,638
crazy texts so um or not usually but sometimes so you

1423
08:47:16,638 --> 08:47:21,280
don't want any suggestions there okay we've done that i wanna take all of

1424
08:47:21,280 --> 08:47:28,240
these items as done in in my notes now the next thing we need to do

1425
08:47:28,240 --> 08:47:34,080
is uh to fix that uh initialization of our firebase app so

1426
08:47:34,080 --> 08:47:38,160
we're gonna do it naively right now so i'm going to go

1427
08:47:38,160 --> 08:47:42,398
because you see we still have this error so if i if i bring this up

1428
08:47:42,398 --> 08:47:45,520
clean the errors and then say

1429
08:47:45,520 --> 08:47:52,958
pixelity a b gmail.com and i say ubar baz

1430
08:47:52,958 --> 08:47:58,000
i say register we will still get this error that says no if no firebase app is

1431
08:47:58,000 --> 08:48:02,718
configured okay so what we need to do is to actually

1432
08:48:02,718 --> 08:48:06,160
register sorry initialize firebase before we do

1433
08:48:06,160 --> 08:48:10,878
firebase instance create user with email and password

1434
08:48:10,878 --> 08:48:15,120
so what we need to do then is to go here

1435
08:48:15,120 --> 08:48:20,558
and say firebase initialize firebase

1436
08:48:20,558 --> 08:48:22,878
app

1437
08:48:22,878 --> 08:48:26,160
see what we have there

1438
08:48:26,160 --> 08:48:32,478
firebase auth instance or initialize app

1439
08:48:32,478 --> 08:48:36,000
i've actually forgotten the syntax for that so

1440
08:48:36,000 --> 08:48:41,280
let's see if we actually can learn how to do that by going to our

1441
08:48:41,280 --> 08:48:44,638
um firebase options

1442
08:48:44,638 --> 08:48:48,080
initialize you can see it should be done like this

1443
08:48:48,080 --> 08:48:52,398
and what we need to do then is to import firebase options as it's as it's showing

1444
08:48:52,398 --> 08:48:57,440
here firebase options and then await firebase.initialize app with this okay

1445
08:48:57,440 --> 08:49:01,840
so let's let's kind of grab that code and then go into our main guard file and

1446
08:49:01,840 --> 08:49:08,318
import firebase options so i'm going to go here and say import

1447
08:49:08,318 --> 08:49:13,280
firebase options and right before we

1448
08:49:13,280 --> 08:49:16,398
do the

1449
08:49:16,398 --> 08:49:19,440
registration here i'm gonna do

1450
08:49:19,440 --> 08:49:23,200
this code that was provided there for us so i'm gonna remove the comments

1451
08:49:23,200 --> 08:49:28,080
command s and i can still see that firebase isn't imported so we're going

1452
08:49:28,080 --> 08:49:32,240
to import it by doing import library package firebase core firebase core here

1453
08:49:32,240 --> 08:49:35,120
what i did here is that i basically took advantage something that's built into

1454
08:49:35,120 --> 08:49:39,440
visual studio code in order for me to get the import statement automatically

1455
08:49:39,440 --> 08:49:42,558
so i'm going to do command dot on it and it says okay

1456
08:49:42,558 --> 08:49:46,798
import this dart file so i'm just gonna take advantage of that why not

1457
08:49:46,798 --> 08:49:51,840
and you can see that it is imported here firebase core

1458
08:49:51,840 --> 08:49:54,878
so now that we've done that um i'm gonna

1459
08:49:54,878 --> 08:50:02,240
press command s my state is preserved in the uh in my phone here and let me bring

1460
08:50:02,240 --> 08:50:07,440
the logs here clean them and then i'm gonna press the register button

1461
08:50:07,440 --> 08:50:11,760
boom uh here and we got an error here and it

1462
08:50:11,760 --> 08:50:15,760
says device unlock initializing all firebase apis and firebase preparing to

1463
08:50:15,760 --> 08:50:21,440
create blah blah and let's actually see what the error was so

1464
08:50:21,440 --> 08:50:25,840
it is on handle exception request failed

1465
08:50:25,840 --> 08:50:29,280
and unreachable host and that is probably

1466
08:50:29,280 --> 08:50:33,600
because i actually don't have proper internet connection on my

1467
08:50:33,600 --> 08:50:35,440
phone here

1468
08:50:35,440 --> 08:50:39,120
so i'm gonna go here and i'm gonna go to settings

1469
08:50:39,120 --> 08:50:43,440
actually great that you're seeing these errors because these things do happen so

1470
08:50:43,440 --> 08:50:47,200
and i'm gonna turn wi-fi on so make sure that it's gonna connect to

1471
08:50:47,200 --> 08:50:50,160
a valid wi-fi here

1472
08:50:50,160 --> 08:50:53,600
and it connected i'm gonna go back to the application

1473
08:50:53,600 --> 08:50:58,718
clear the logs oh my god there are so many things displayed there

1474
08:50:58,718 --> 08:51:01,600
so then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna repeat the same thing i'm gonna say

1475
08:51:01,600 --> 08:51:04,240
register now so

1476
08:51:04,240 --> 08:51:10,398
now we got to the next state that i have prepared that it

1477
08:51:10,398 --> 08:51:15,280
says you can see in the errors it says configuration not found now

1478
08:51:15,280 --> 08:51:20,798
what is happening here i'm not taking my notes that we've talked about the other

1479
08:51:20,798 --> 08:51:24,638
part of the code what is happening here is that

1480
08:51:24,638 --> 08:51:30,000
we haven't actually told firebase that we are going to take advantage of

1481
08:51:30,000 --> 08:51:34,318
email and password signing combination as i told you before there are various

1482
08:51:34,318 --> 08:51:40,718
way for various ways for a firebase to allow us to register a user uh apple

1483
08:51:40,718 --> 08:51:45,600
login um you can do email and password combination you can do facebook you can

1484
08:51:45,600 --> 08:51:48,958
do google maybe twitter as well yeah i think

1485
08:51:48,958 --> 08:51:53,680
twitter was there as well so you need to tell firebase that um

1486
08:51:53,680 --> 08:52:00,080
we basically want to allow this combination all right

1487
08:52:00,080 --> 08:52:03,520
so now i've explained that let's bring up

1488
08:52:03,520 --> 08:52:09,680
safari or your favorite browser maybe chrome and let's go to uh console

1489
08:52:09,680 --> 08:52:13,680
firebase google.com i'm going to bring my browser on the screen so you can also

1490
08:52:13,680 --> 08:52:17,760
see it and i'm going to then find our

1491
08:52:17,760 --> 08:52:22,798
application which was called uh my notes flutter project okay so go

1492
08:52:22,798 --> 08:52:25,520
to consolefirebase.google.com and find your

1493
08:52:25,520 --> 08:52:29,520
project that you created in the previous chapter click on it

1494
08:52:29,520 --> 08:52:33,280
then go to authentication as i as i show you here

1495
08:52:33,280 --> 08:52:36,878
and let's see uh

1496
08:52:36,878 --> 08:52:41,920
authentication actually get started

1497
08:52:41,920 --> 08:52:45,760
and in sign in uh what we need is this email and

1498
08:52:45,760 --> 08:52:49,760
password combination so go email and password combination and just allow it

1499
08:52:49,760 --> 08:52:53,920
all right so and then press save

1500
08:52:53,920 --> 08:52:56,958
and that's it that's all you have to do so i'm gonna

1501
08:52:56,958 --> 08:52:59,760
grab this screen just kind of bring it to another

1502
08:52:59,760 --> 08:53:05,200
monitor so you don't see it clean the logs and then say register

1503
08:53:05,200 --> 08:53:09,680
so you can see now all of a sudden you got user credentials back from firebase

1504
08:53:09,680 --> 08:53:14,080
so you actually could now um

1505
08:53:14,080 --> 08:53:19,360
register your application like register a real user with firebase like that is

1506
08:53:19,360 --> 08:53:23,520
actually magical so i'm gonna click on my notes that i've talked about

1507
08:53:23,520 --> 08:53:26,558
that so

1508
08:53:26,558 --> 08:53:30,478
however you see this this is a little bit problematic in that by pressing the

1509
08:53:30,478 --> 08:53:34,718
button but we're actually initializing an application and then we're doing the

1510
08:53:34,718 --> 08:53:38,718
create user with email and password what would happen if you had two or three

1511
08:53:38,718 --> 08:53:43,280
buttons on the screen all needing firebase you can't do firebase

1512
08:53:43,280 --> 08:53:47,600
initialize app in every single one of them so the solution to this is kind of

1513
08:53:47,600 --> 08:53:52,398
like initializing your firebase application before you

1514
08:53:52,398 --> 08:53:57,200
start and start with everything else in your in your on your screen and on your

1515
08:53:57,200 --> 08:54:01,760
phone so there is good documentation of how to do

1516
08:54:01,760 --> 08:54:05,760
that and i've actually linked to that so i'm going to bring it here

1517
08:54:05,760 --> 08:54:10,558
so what we need to do is take advantage of something called widgets flutter

1518
08:54:10,558 --> 08:54:13,520
binding and

1519
08:54:13,520 --> 08:54:19,040
what happens to be honest with you here is that firebase it needs some

1520
08:54:19,040 --> 08:54:23,200
it needs to kick start its process before everything

1521
08:54:23,200 --> 08:54:28,718
else is rendered on the screen and in order for that to happen it needs to it

1522
08:54:28,718 --> 08:54:33,440
needs to have some sort of that like the core flutter engine to be in place

1523
08:54:33,440 --> 08:54:37,120
and so that it can make its call to the core slaughter engine and say that i'm

1524
08:54:37,120 --> 08:54:42,638
done with my work so in order to do that then you need something called um

1525
08:54:42,638 --> 08:54:46,718
widgets flutter binding so i'm gonna

1526
08:54:46,718 --> 08:54:52,080
i'm gonna bring up the um caption for that and i can show

1527
08:54:52,080 --> 08:54:54,878
you that i'm this is this is the documentation that i'm showing you as of

1528
08:54:54,878 --> 08:54:57,360
linked there so

1529
08:54:57,360 --> 08:55:02,718
in our in your void function here um before we actually you see

1530
08:55:02,718 --> 08:55:06,398
maybe i'm jumping over a little bit but what we're trying to do is to try to fix

1531
08:55:06,398 --> 08:55:11,120
this issue here that we're awaiting on initialize app on firebase okay so we

1532
08:55:11,120 --> 08:55:14,000
don't want to do this on the press of a button we actually want to do it

1533
08:55:14,000 --> 08:55:17,760
somewhere else and in order to be able to do that somewhere else we have to

1534
08:55:17,760 --> 08:55:23,120
first take care of this widget binding okay so in your main function in here

1535
08:55:23,120 --> 08:55:27,120
then say um i think we need to say

1536
08:55:27,120 --> 08:55:33,520
widgets flutter binding dot ensure initialized like that

1537
08:55:33,520 --> 08:55:37,440
okay and if you want to know more about that i strongly suggest that you read

1538
08:55:37,440 --> 08:55:42,080
this documentation that i've provided here okay

1539
08:55:42,080 --> 08:55:47,360
so now that that is in place um now that you've done that do a hot

1540
08:55:47,360 --> 08:55:50,718
restart okay so you're gonna lose your state

1541
08:55:50,718 --> 08:55:53,920
here after the hot restart and that's okay

1542
08:55:53,920 --> 08:55:58,398
i'm gonna take that in my notes that i've talked about that

1543
08:55:58,398 --> 08:56:02,318
now as you know this initialize

1544
08:56:02,318 --> 08:56:07,680
app is a future you see it's a future of firebase app now what you need to do is

1545
08:56:07,680 --> 08:56:15,360
kind of like you want to tell flutter to not build this column before it has

1546
08:56:15,360 --> 08:56:19,280
finished doing that future and

1547
08:56:19,280 --> 08:56:25,840
the way to do that is using flutter's future builder widget future builder it

1548
08:56:25,840 --> 08:56:29,840
takes a future it performs the future and once this

1549
08:56:29,840 --> 08:56:34,958
future has succeeded or it has failed doing its work it will give you a call

1550
08:56:34,958 --> 08:56:39,600
back and in that callback it asks you to actually produce a widget you want to

1551
08:56:39,600 --> 08:56:42,478
display to the user depending on the state

1552
08:56:42,478 --> 08:56:47,680
of that futures result so it basically instead of you having to do this

1553
08:56:47,680 --> 08:56:52,558
initialization of firebase every time a user presses the button you say i'm not

1554
08:56:52,558 --> 08:56:57,840
going to do anything until that is done once that is done or if it errors out

1555
08:56:57,840 --> 08:57:01,520
let me know then i will give you a widget to display to the user depending

1556
08:57:01,520 --> 08:57:05,680
on the results okay so what we're gonna do

1557
08:57:05,680 --> 08:57:10,478
is gonna go to this body which is a column right now command dot and then

1558
08:57:10,478 --> 08:57:14,240
let's see stream builder we have but we don't have future builder so i'm just

1559
08:57:14,240 --> 08:57:19,680
gonna say command dot wrap with widget

1560
08:57:19,680 --> 08:57:24,398
and i'm gonna say future builder okay so i'm gonna build a future as you can see

1561
08:57:24,398 --> 08:57:28,718
it says okay builder is required so let's put a

1562
08:57:28,718 --> 08:57:33,040
builder parameter here and if you're like me and you forget these syntaxes

1563
08:57:33,040 --> 08:57:37,360
you can just control space in visual studio code on mac or command space in

1564
08:57:37,360 --> 08:57:42,798
linux and windows to get help and then you'll just use this syntax

1565
08:57:42,798 --> 08:57:48,718
there okay so bring your entire column

1566
08:57:48,718 --> 08:57:53,680
here you see this until the end of the column without the comma

1567
08:57:53,680 --> 08:57:57,120
then you remove your child bring that entire thing and put a return here and

1568
08:57:57,120 --> 08:58:00,638
just place it there okay like that

1569
08:58:00,638 --> 08:58:07,200
now your future builder um it doesn't have an actual future to come to perform

1570
08:58:07,200 --> 08:58:11,040
so for its future

1571
08:58:11,040 --> 08:58:14,478
let's see i wanna say that we've talked about the future

1572
08:58:14,478 --> 08:58:16,958
builder

1573
08:58:16,958 --> 08:58:20,878
and what we need to do now is to grab this future from here you see

1574
08:58:20,878 --> 08:58:25,760
await firebase initialize app and grab that future without the weight remove

1575
08:58:25,760 --> 08:58:31,120
the weight and put it in the future builders future

1576
08:58:31,120 --> 08:58:34,958
parameter like that

1577
08:58:34,958 --> 08:58:37,040
all right command s

1578
08:58:37,040 --> 08:58:40,478
on a hot restart and

1579
08:58:40,478 --> 08:58:44,798
you can see nothing has really happened on the screen so

1580
08:58:44,798 --> 08:58:49,440
you didn't have any difference you don't notice any difference basically

1581
08:58:49,440 --> 08:58:52,958
so if everything really worked as it should

1582
08:58:52,958 --> 08:58:57,840
um then what we need to do then is to

1583
08:58:57,840 --> 08:59:01,600
um if everything is working as expected then we should be able to register users

1584
08:59:01,600 --> 08:59:07,760
so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to provide the exact same user

1585
08:59:07,760 --> 08:59:13,600
already registered and then say register and you'll see now we get an error

1586
08:59:13,600 --> 08:59:17,520
let's see if i can show you there and it says the error is firebase auth email

1587
08:59:17,520 --> 08:59:22,160
already in use the email or the email address is already in use by another

1588
08:59:22,160 --> 08:59:25,520
account and that is this part which i'm gonna

1589
08:59:25,520 --> 08:59:29,360
bring the caption up for you

1590
08:59:29,360 --> 08:59:36,000
so we've also talked about that

1591
08:59:36,000 --> 08:59:38,160
all right so

1592
08:59:38,160 --> 08:59:42,840
the next topic that i want to talk about before we close off and round off this

1593
08:59:42,840 --> 08:59:47,760
uh chapter is connection states you see

1594
08:59:47,760 --> 08:59:50,558
we told future builder to perform a future

1595
08:59:50,558 --> 08:59:54,718
the future was firebase initialize app okay this thing

1596
08:59:54,718 --> 08:59:58,398
now if you look at the builder what we're returning from it right now is a

1597
08:59:58,398 --> 09:00:02,318
column but we're completely ignoring the parameters that are coming in here

1598
09:00:02,318 --> 09:00:05,120
the second parameter that gets passed your builder is something called a

1599
09:00:05,120 --> 09:00:09,120
snapshot of data type async snapshot as you can see there

1600
09:00:09,120 --> 09:00:14,398
an async snapshot of an object is the state of that object right now okay

1601
09:00:14,398 --> 09:00:19,040
so and that object itself is actually the result of your future in this case

1602
09:00:19,040 --> 09:00:22,478
firebase app so it's just that

1603
09:00:22,478 --> 09:00:26,478
it didn't understand that this snapshot is an async snapshot of your firebase

1604
09:00:26,478 --> 09:00:30,798
app but that's okay we don't actually need the firebase app in the snapshot

1605
09:00:30,798 --> 09:00:36,398
however one thing that you do need in this snapshot is its state you see a

1606
09:00:36,398 --> 09:00:42,160
future has a start point it has a line where it processes its information and

1607
09:00:42,160 --> 09:00:48,240
it has an end point it either ends successfully or it fails now the

1608
09:00:48,240 --> 09:00:54,638
snapshot is your way of getting the results of your future whether it

1609
09:00:54,638 --> 09:01:00,160
has it started is it processing is it done or did it fail so what we need to

1610
09:01:00,160 --> 09:01:05,840
do in here as we're waiting for firebase initialize app to do its work we're

1611
09:01:05,840 --> 09:01:11,200
gonna basically say uh we're loading just tell the user loading and as soon

1612
09:01:11,200 --> 09:01:14,000
as the snapshot is done then we're gonna say that

1613
09:01:14,000 --> 09:01:17,920
loading has finished

1614
09:01:17,920 --> 09:01:21,360
so let's do that let's go in here and say

1615
09:01:21,360 --> 09:01:25,040
switch snapshot

1616
09:01:25,040 --> 09:01:28,240
i believe it's called

1617
09:01:28,240 --> 09:01:32,798
connection state all right and then get help from visual studio code to complete

1618
09:01:32,798 --> 09:01:35,600
this so i'm going to say add missing case clauses and you can see there are

1619
09:01:35,600 --> 09:01:39,920
so many different cases right

1620
09:01:39,920 --> 09:01:44,398
done waiting active and done all right so

1621
09:01:44,398 --> 09:01:47,600
for none

1622
09:01:47,600 --> 09:01:52,958
waiting let's let's just say everything else except for done we're gonna return

1623
09:01:52,958 --> 09:01:57,280
like a text that just says loading so

1624
09:01:57,280 --> 09:02:02,160
let's say in here we remove all of these okay

1625
09:02:02,160 --> 09:02:07,280
in the done statement we say return this entire column

1626
09:02:07,280 --> 09:02:10,878
all the way here

1627
09:02:10,878 --> 09:02:15,120
right and then we don't need the break because we said return and then we're

1628
09:02:15,120 --> 09:02:20,160
going to say default default is a special case which is not

1629
09:02:20,160 --> 09:02:24,958
actually inside that enumeration but is a case that says everything else that i

1630
09:02:24,958 --> 09:02:30,080
haven't handled and in this case we just say return text

1631
09:02:30,080 --> 09:02:35,280
loading something like this as a constant okay

1632
09:02:35,280 --> 09:02:39,680
so i'm gonna heart reload sorry hot restart and the two hours

1633
09:02:39,680 --> 09:02:42,958
video this is happening so fast that we're not actually seeing the loading

1634
09:02:42,958 --> 09:02:46,798
but at least we have handled the case that if for instance a user's connection

1635
09:02:46,798 --> 09:02:52,000
is too slow or their device is too slow when the future has finished they will

1636
09:02:52,000 --> 09:02:54,958
see this column i'm gonna actually fold it

1637
09:02:54,958 --> 09:02:58,798
and if this feature hasn't finished yet it's not done then they will see this

1638
09:02:58,798 --> 09:03:02,398
text offloading all right and by the way this is how you can actually fold and

1639
09:03:02,398 --> 09:03:06,080
unfold things in visual studio code so fold

1640
09:03:06,080 --> 09:03:13,680
fold like this unfold all right it's a great way of seeing more of your code so

1641
09:03:13,680 --> 09:03:18,958
wow a lot of information this this video took an hour kind of like as i expected

1642
09:03:18,958 --> 09:03:24,318
um so we now have a basic firebase setup

1643
09:03:24,318 --> 09:03:28,160
we've done our initialization of the application of our firebase we talked

1644
09:03:28,160 --> 09:03:31,520
about a lot of widgets actually we talked about column

1645
09:03:31,520 --> 09:03:36,080
column we text talked about text future builder

1646
09:03:36,080 --> 09:03:39,200
text field container

1647
09:03:39,200 --> 09:03:44,558
god app bar so many things so this is a lot of content and if you

1648
09:03:44,558 --> 09:03:48,080
didn't get all of it that's okay we're gonna talk more about these in the

1649
09:03:48,080 --> 09:03:52,718
upcoming chapters but i strongly suggest that i mean if

1650
09:03:52,718 --> 09:03:57,680
you're watching this course and if you're just watching it

1651
09:03:57,680 --> 09:04:00,478
and if you're an advanced developer and

1652
09:04:00,478 --> 09:04:04,240
you're watching that's completely fine but if you're if you're develop if

1653
09:04:04,240 --> 09:04:09,200
you're not a developer or if you're a junior developer or someone who

1654
09:04:09,200 --> 09:04:12,398
doesn't have so much experience with flutter development and you're really

1655
09:04:12,398 --> 09:04:16,478
trying to learn everything i'm saying here please don't just watch this video

1656
09:04:16,478 --> 09:04:21,680
go and do this yourself go and write this code pause the video as i'm talking

1657
09:04:21,680 --> 09:04:25,040
i know i'll talk a little bit fast but that's just to save a little bit of time

1658
09:04:25,040 --> 09:04:29,200
pause the video write the code as i write it test it as i test it and see

1659
09:04:29,200 --> 09:04:32,798
the results for yourself because that's how you will learn not just by watching

1660
09:04:32,798 --> 09:04:36,718
so great we've talked a lot about

1661
09:04:36,718 --> 09:04:42,160
widgets and firebase configuration and in the next chapter we're going to

1662
09:04:42,160 --> 09:04:47,200
talk about login screen and also email verification and also clean up our

1663
09:04:47,200 --> 09:04:51,440
registration screen so without further ado let's just prepare yourself for the

1664
09:04:51,440 --> 09:04:56,718
next chapter and i'll see you there hello and welcome to chapter 13 of this

1665
09:04:56,718 --> 09:04:59,760
flutter course in this chapter we're going to talk

1666
09:04:59,760 --> 09:05:05,200
about the login view in chapter 12 as i can see here

1667
09:05:05,200 --> 09:05:10,080
sorry about that we talked about the registration flow and

1668
09:05:10,080 --> 09:05:13,760
we actually talked about quite a lot of things which after after that i i

1669
09:05:13,760 --> 09:05:18,878
thought maybe we need to kind of like go through them one more time just

1670
09:05:18,878 --> 09:05:21,920
every now and then talk about those those little widgets that we talked

1671
09:05:21,920 --> 09:05:26,958
about like a future builder center column text button and we talked also

1672
09:05:26,958 --> 09:05:30,718
about um text field text editing controller so

1673
09:05:30,718 --> 09:05:34,160
there were lots of components that we talked about but we got pretty much like

1674
09:05:34,160 --> 09:05:37,200
a a simple registration flow working it

1675
09:05:37,200 --> 09:05:41,520
wasn't really a flow actually it was just a simple registration screen

1676
09:05:41,520 --> 09:05:45,440
i'm saying that it wasn't a flow because it was just a simple screen that didn't

1677
09:05:45,440 --> 09:05:48,718
lean anywhere that's usually what is called the flow if you have a screen

1678
09:05:48,718 --> 09:05:52,478
that leads somewhere now in this chapter we're going to talk

1679
09:05:52,478 --> 09:05:56,878
about login the login view and we're also going to divide the logic that

1680
09:05:56,878 --> 09:06:03,120
we've created in our current home page and put it into a registration view so

1681
09:06:03,120 --> 09:06:06,558
we're by the end of this chapter we're gonna have two views one is for the

1682
09:06:06,558 --> 09:06:11,758
registration the other one is for the login okay

1683
09:06:11,758 --> 09:06:16,960
so as i've shown you here um we have those logic i mean the

1684
09:06:16,960 --> 09:06:20,800
registration logic in place now we have to work on login but we also work a

1685
09:06:20,800 --> 09:06:23,598
little bit on cleaning up the code because

1686
09:06:23,598 --> 09:06:26,718
usually this i mean as you get more and more comfortable with software

1687
09:06:26,718 --> 09:06:30,878
development you'll know that you will have like these flows of ideas

1688
09:06:30,878 --> 09:06:34,320
and then you'll start coding and write your code and then you test it and then

1689
09:06:34,320 --> 09:06:38,238
after a while you realize oh this got a little bit messy i have to refactor the

1690
09:06:38,238 --> 09:06:42,320
code so that's what refactoring kind of means like you take what is already

1691
09:06:42,320 --> 09:06:46,078
there and you kind of make it better make it cleaner more presentable so

1692
09:06:46,078 --> 09:06:50,398
that's what we're also going to do in this chapter

1693
09:06:50,398 --> 09:06:55,840
so the first thing we need to do is to create a stateful register view widget

1694
09:06:55,840 --> 09:06:58,878
okay so as you can see here this will be used

1695
09:06:58,878 --> 09:07:03,840
as the base of our register view

1696
09:07:03,840 --> 09:07:06,878
so let me go and bring some stuff that

1697
09:07:06,878 --> 09:07:11,680
we're going to need in this chapter the first one is my scr

1698
09:07:11,680 --> 09:07:14,800
i bring it to the screen so you'll see it as well

1699
09:07:14,800 --> 09:07:18,480
and scr cpy we set it up in one of the previous chapters so you should be

1700
09:07:18,480 --> 09:07:21,520
comfortable with that already um

1701
09:07:21,520 --> 09:07:25,520
i'm going to go to go to our app here which is the register view that we

1702
09:07:25,520 --> 09:07:29,040
created gonna bring my face to the right so we'll see a bit more of the content

1703
09:07:29,040 --> 09:07:33,200
on the screen and then i'm also going to bring up

1704
09:07:33,200 --> 09:07:38,320
visual studio code which is appearing on another screen right now but i'll bring

1705
09:07:38,320 --> 09:07:42,160
it up here so you'll see as well i'm going to increase the size a little

1706
09:07:42,160 --> 09:07:46,480
bit as well so it becomes easier to see

1707
09:07:46,480 --> 09:07:51,278
so this is where we lift things um let me bring up

1708
09:07:51,278 --> 09:07:55,598
and do the screen like this so this is where we live things we have a home page

1709
09:07:55,598 --> 09:08:00,718
which at the moment is the register view okay but we need to create a register

1710
09:08:00,718 --> 09:08:05,758
view like not just a home page it's called the home page so

1711
09:08:05,758 --> 09:08:09,122
and since we need a stateful widget we're going to use a shortcut in visual

1712
09:08:09,122 --> 09:08:13,840
studio code to create a stateful widget for us and that is with s t f as in

1713
09:08:13,840 --> 09:08:19,758
state full so if you want to create a stateless widget you'd say stl okay

1714
09:08:19,758 --> 09:08:23,918
so stf and in here we're going to call it what

1715
09:08:23,918 --> 09:08:29,360
should we say register view like that all right

1716
09:08:29,360 --> 09:08:33,200
so this will be as i've mentioned here this

1717
09:08:33,200 --> 09:08:39,918
will be the base of our

1718
09:08:39,918 --> 09:08:43,438
this will be the base of our registration view all the code for

1719
09:08:43,438 --> 09:08:47,040
register will appear here i'm sorry that i'm looking

1720
09:08:47,040 --> 09:08:50,718
here just to make sure that i'm basically

1721
09:08:50,718 --> 09:08:53,680
going through my notes i have very detailed notes here and just making sure

1722
09:08:53,680 --> 09:08:56,640
that you get all the information that i plan for you to get so if you see me

1723
09:08:56,640 --> 09:08:59,680
looking here it's just because i'm looking at the notes to ensure that

1724
09:08:59,680 --> 09:09:02,640
um so now that we've created register view at the moment it doesn't have

1725
09:09:02,640 --> 09:09:06,398
anything so it's just a container and the default color for containers and

1726
09:09:06,398 --> 09:09:11,520
background is black so let's go to our register view here

1727
09:09:11,520 --> 09:09:14,640
so let's go to our main function here and as you can see at the moment we're

1728
09:09:14,640 --> 09:09:18,640
returning home page as the home and what we're going to do here is just to say

1729
09:09:18,640 --> 09:09:22,718
instead of that return register view okay

1730
09:09:22,718 --> 09:09:26,480
and that is it's very possible we will get a problem here and you can see

1731
09:09:26,480 --> 09:09:30,718
nothing is changing because i'm changing something inside the main and that isn't

1732
09:09:30,718 --> 09:09:36,000
affected really by a hot reload so we have to hot restart so i'm gonna

1733
09:09:36,000 --> 09:09:39,598
go how to restart here and you can see now the screen is black

1734
09:09:39,598 --> 09:09:41,520
so um

1735
09:09:41,520 --> 09:09:45,598
that part is basically done

1736
09:09:45,598 --> 09:09:51,680
so what we'll have to do here now is to rename our home page to our login view

1737
09:09:51,680 --> 09:09:56,000
actually so we have a new registration view which we're going to write the code

1738
09:09:56,000 --> 09:10:00,320
for or actually place the code from the previous home page into register view

1739
09:10:00,320 --> 09:10:05,360
and we also need the home page to be renamed so it's very some i mean there's

1740
09:10:05,360 --> 09:10:09,040
lots of renaming putting things here and there but we're just playing with some

1741
09:10:09,040 --> 09:10:12,320
names basically here so the next thing you need to do is to go

1742
09:10:12,320 --> 09:10:16,640
to your home page which is here and rename it one way to do that visual

1743
09:10:16,640 --> 09:10:21,278
studio code is to right click on it and just say rename symbol or i believe it's

1744
09:10:21,278 --> 09:10:25,680
also command f2

1745
09:10:25,680 --> 09:10:30,558
or actually for me it's f2 if two does the renaming but on a macbook pro for

1746
09:10:30,558 --> 09:10:34,878
instance you don't you can't just press f2 because f2 has another function

1747
09:10:34,878 --> 09:10:39,598
so what you'll need to do is to press function keyboard keep key on your

1748
09:10:39,598 --> 09:10:43,360
keyboard and then press f2 that will bring up the rename dialog or you could

1749
09:10:43,360 --> 09:10:47,598
just right click here and just say rename symbol which does the same thing

1750
09:10:47,598 --> 09:10:53,758
so rename your home page to login view okay

1751
09:10:53,758 --> 09:10:58,800
all right so we have login view here now um i'm gonna take it that we've done the

1752
09:10:58,800 --> 09:11:02,398
rename um you see

1753
09:11:02,398 --> 09:11:06,640
right now all we've been doing here is just to like write our code write

1754
09:11:06,640 --> 09:11:11,438
everything in main dart but this is this is not a not the right way of doing

1755
09:11:11,438 --> 09:11:15,840
things especially as your projects get bigger you need to make sure that you're

1756
09:11:15,840 --> 09:11:19,278
you're taking the responsibility to also make sure that your code is readable and

1757
09:11:19,278 --> 09:11:22,960
the structure of your project is understandable by others who may also be

1758
09:11:22,960 --> 09:11:27,200
working on the same project now chances are that if you're watching this course

1759
09:11:27,200 --> 09:11:31,840
that you will be the only person working on the source code so you won't have

1760
09:11:31,840 --> 09:11:35,918
anybody else looking at your code even though

1761
09:11:35,918 --> 09:11:39,520
that you may be the only person looking at the code and working with it you

1762
09:11:39,520 --> 09:11:44,640
still will need to from time and time come back to the project fix some stuff

1763
09:11:44,640 --> 09:11:49,758
add some stuff remove some stuff so even if you're the only person working

1764
09:11:49,758 --> 09:11:55,360
with it you will need a clean source code to look at so if you come

1765
09:11:55,360 --> 09:11:58,640
back to the source code after a month and you start to add more and more stuff

1766
09:11:58,640 --> 09:12:02,640
to this main dart file after a while it will just get out of control so

1767
09:12:02,640 --> 09:12:06,160
you'll need to also do refactoring on your code just to ensure that it is in a

1768
09:12:06,160 --> 09:12:09,200
clean state so what we're going to do is to bring up

1769
09:12:09,200 --> 09:12:13,438
our project browser here as you can see we're inside lib and then

1770
09:12:13,438 --> 09:12:18,078
there's a file called main dart what we need to do here is

1771
09:12:18,078 --> 09:12:23,758
to move our login view into its own file and you can see here i've written that

1772
09:12:23,758 --> 09:12:27,918
we're going to move it into lib views login view this file doesn't exist at

1773
09:12:27,918 --> 09:12:32,160
the moment so you'll need to create it what you'll do here i mean in visual

1774
09:12:32,160 --> 09:12:36,960
studio code there's a great trick that you can do that it can create a file on

1775
09:12:36,960 --> 09:12:41,520
all the intermediate folders as well so instead of going here

1776
09:12:41,520 --> 09:12:46,800
and say new folder to create this views folder and then inside there i create a

1777
09:12:46,800 --> 09:12:50,398
login view what you'll need to do just say new file

1778
09:12:50,398 --> 09:12:54,238
and then type the entire path in there so just say

1779
09:12:54,238 --> 09:12:59,840
views and then slash login view dot dart and this will create the views folder

1780
09:12:59,840 --> 09:13:04,398
for you so it's great um

1781
09:13:04,398 --> 09:13:09,680
so what i'll need to do here is to take our login views code as you can see

1782
09:13:09,680 --> 09:13:12,320
here

1783
09:13:12,320 --> 09:13:18,640
as we had here class login view and then bring all that code into this new login

1784
09:13:18,640 --> 09:13:22,078
view file that we just created okay so i'm gonna get this out of the way

1785
09:13:22,078 --> 09:13:24,558
here and just paste it

1786
09:13:24,558 --> 09:13:28,878
all right and that's okay we're getting a lot of errors here and the reason

1787
09:13:28,878 --> 09:13:33,598
behind that is i mean we haven't talked about import statements so much before

1788
09:13:33,598 --> 09:13:38,398
but import statement is a way for you as a programmer to bring

1789
09:13:38,398 --> 09:13:42,800
in code written by others whether it is the flutter team at google

1790
09:13:42,800 --> 09:13:46,320
or whether it is a third party third-party dependency

1791
09:13:46,320 --> 09:13:49,598
and tell your flutter

1792
09:13:49,598 --> 09:13:53,122
project where those pieces of code are and at

1793
09:13:53,122 --> 09:13:55,520
the moment i mean if you're not coming from a

1794
09:13:55,520 --> 09:13:58,960
software engineering background you're not familiar with imports

1795
09:13:58,960 --> 09:14:03,278
this is um i mean the closest analogy that i can find is

1796
09:14:03,278 --> 09:14:06,238
as if for instance in figma you've created

1797
09:14:06,238 --> 09:14:10,078
um you're trying to create an instance of a

1798
09:14:10,078 --> 09:14:12,878
design that you've already created but figment doesn't know where that instance

1799
09:14:12,878 --> 09:14:17,278
is so you'll say oh here's a copy of the button instance

1800
09:14:17,278 --> 09:14:20,238
and then figma is like oh where can i find that button you haven't even

1801
09:14:20,238 --> 09:14:24,558
created it so then you need to first go create that button or drag it in from

1802
09:14:24,558 --> 09:14:27,520
another project and put it in your components

1803
09:14:27,520 --> 09:14:31,438
page and then you can create an instance of it so

1804
09:14:31,438 --> 09:14:35,918
if you're not into design and figma you may not understand what i just

1805
09:14:35,918 --> 09:14:38,640
said but what i'm trying to do is just to be as

1806
09:14:38,640 --> 09:14:41,758
inclusive as possible in this course to make sure anybody who's following this

1807
09:14:41,758 --> 09:14:45,438
course will try to at least understand bits and

1808
09:14:45,438 --> 09:14:48,718
pieces of what i'm saying so

1809
09:14:48,718 --> 09:14:52,398
going back to import what we need to do now is to tell flutter where those

1810
09:14:52,398 --> 09:14:57,360
pieces of highlighted code are and one thing to do in visual studio code which

1811
09:14:57,360 --> 09:15:01,122
can help you greatly if you're trying to go around this

1812
09:15:01,122 --> 09:15:07,200
writing things by hand is just to do command on mac or control on linux and

1813
09:15:07,200 --> 09:15:10,800
windows hold down command or control depending on your operating system and

1814
09:15:10,800 --> 09:15:14,640
press dot then you will see suggestions here as

1815
09:15:14,640 --> 09:15:19,438
where those components those missing components may be placed and what you'll

1816
09:15:19,438 --> 09:15:23,278
need to do here is just to import package flutter material because that's

1817
09:15:23,278 --> 09:15:28,480
where these components that we're using are actually placed so oops

1818
09:15:28,480 --> 09:15:34,160
i managed to click the wrong wrong option there so material boom

1819
09:15:34,160 --> 09:15:39,360
all right i think now almost everything has disappeared all almost every error

1820
09:15:39,360 --> 09:15:42,718
has disappeared except for these firebase errors so

1821
09:15:42,718 --> 09:15:46,558
let's go and let's see

1822
09:15:46,558 --> 09:15:49,598
so let's go in there

1823
09:15:49,598 --> 09:15:54,320
and say now firebase core import that

1824
09:15:54,320 --> 09:15:59,520
and also here we need to import minors firebase options okay

1825
09:15:59,520 --> 09:16:04,078
so i think everything basically is disappeared there's also firebase auth

1826
09:16:04,078 --> 09:16:07,758
import that as well alright so we're good to go now on this

1827
09:16:07,758 --> 09:16:13,918
login view however remember this login views code really is not

1828
09:16:13,918 --> 09:16:17,520
login view i mean if you remember the code that we've written in the previous

1829
09:16:17,520 --> 09:16:21,360
chapter this login view at the moment it says

1830
09:16:21,360 --> 09:16:25,200
log view but all it does is register do you remember that we have the text field

1831
09:16:25,200 --> 09:16:29,840
and even the button that says register so

1832
09:16:29,840 --> 09:16:34,078
what we need to do now is to drag the code as you can see here from

1833
09:16:34,078 --> 09:16:37,918
the login view here we need to kind of bring it into the

1834
09:16:37,918 --> 09:16:43,200
register view okay and our register view at the moment is here you see

1835
09:16:43,200 --> 09:16:47,278
there so let's go and try to do that a little

1836
09:16:47,278 --> 09:16:52,320
bit with care okay so grab all this code that is here in the login view here

1837
09:16:52,320 --> 09:16:56,078
there get dispose in its state

1838
09:16:56,078 --> 09:17:01,680
and also grab your email and password and member variables

1839
09:17:01,680 --> 09:17:06,000
from here and cut them

1840
09:17:06,000 --> 09:17:10,718
so i'm gonna go then in here in the register view state

1841
09:17:10,718 --> 09:17:16,878
then paste those right before the build function so there we go okay

1842
09:17:16,878 --> 09:17:21,520
go back to login view dart and you can see that there is a build function here

1843
09:17:21,520 --> 09:17:24,558
here and

1844
09:17:24,558 --> 09:17:28,878
i'm going to literally just grab that entire build function including the

1845
09:17:28,878 --> 09:17:31,122
override and

1846
09:17:31,122 --> 09:17:36,078
as i can see here the build function ends right there and i'm gonna cut that

1847
09:17:36,078 --> 09:17:43,122
also okay and i'm gonna go here and replace this override on the um

1848
09:17:43,122 --> 09:17:48,800
on the what is it called register view and paste that one from before here okay

1849
09:17:48,800 --> 09:17:53,200
so what all we did here is we made sure that the register view

1850
09:17:53,200 --> 09:17:57,200
it is indeed the register view and the login view is empty at the moment so

1851
09:17:57,200 --> 09:18:00,480
what you'll need to do you see there's an error here that says that okay you

1852
09:18:00,480 --> 09:18:06,320
have a stateful widget for login but it doesn't have any build function

1853
09:18:06,320 --> 09:18:10,320
so you'll now need to create that build function and of course you could do it

1854
09:18:10,320 --> 09:18:13,200
by hand

1855
09:18:13,200 --> 09:18:16,160
but it's i mean

1856
09:18:16,160 --> 09:18:19,438
it's not really it's not really that

1857
09:18:19,438 --> 09:18:23,040
good of an idea to

1858
09:18:23,040 --> 09:18:26,480
write all that code by hand of course in the beginning you may say that oh well i

1859
09:18:26,480 --> 09:18:30,238
just want to learn the best way to learn is to type and i completely understand

1860
09:18:30,238 --> 09:18:33,680
that but there are some things like there are limits i also believe like

1861
09:18:33,680 --> 09:18:36,960
once you've done it once or twice you'll kind of get bored of doing that or

1862
09:18:36,960 --> 09:18:40,238
you'll get tired of doing that so i actually suggest that for these

1863
09:18:40,238 --> 09:18:43,438
functions that you're overriding the best way is actually get your editor

1864
09:18:43,438 --> 09:18:47,758
text editor or ide to complete these things for you so i'm going to go on

1865
09:18:47,758 --> 09:18:52,878
this error and just say command dot on mac and control dot on linux and windows

1866
09:18:52,878 --> 09:19:00,160
and say create one missing override okay and in here we just say return

1867
09:19:00,160 --> 09:19:04,320
okay so that's our login view and you can see

1868
09:19:04,320 --> 09:19:06,960
here now we have

1869
09:19:06,960 --> 09:19:11,360
a register view that is right here and then we also have

1870
09:19:11,360 --> 09:19:14,960
a login view all right

1871
09:19:14,960 --> 09:19:18,800
so let's go then

1872
09:19:18,800 --> 09:19:22,960
in our main dart file here i can see that there is a register and let's just

1873
09:19:22,960 --> 09:19:28,320
actually restart this hot restart okay so we have a register

1874
09:19:28,320 --> 09:19:33,520
and our login view is completely empty so

1875
09:19:33,520 --> 09:19:38,240
now um what we need to do basically is kind of

1876
09:19:38,240 --> 09:19:41,120
like um

1877
09:19:41,120 --> 09:19:45,276
it's kind of work on our login view because this is this is like the goal of

1878
09:19:45,276 --> 09:19:49,200
this chapter we need to have a login view and up

1879
09:19:49,200 --> 09:19:52,080
until this point what we've been doing is kind of like create a register view

1880
09:19:52,080 --> 09:19:55,120
with all the code in it a separate login view

1881
09:19:55,120 --> 09:19:59,840
which was our previously previously created registry so

1882
09:19:59,840 --> 09:20:03,596
i mean this is all a lot of talk just to say that we have a registered view

1883
09:20:03,596 --> 09:20:06,960
but we don't have a login view and we need to work on login views so

1884
09:20:06,960 --> 09:20:10,320
if you remember um wow i mean you don't actually have to

1885
09:20:10,320 --> 09:20:13,596
remember you can look at it here the register view has two fields enter your

1886
09:20:13,596 --> 09:20:16,640
email here and for your password here and

1887
09:20:16,640 --> 09:20:21,276
this is this their register v and login are very similar to each other what

1888
09:20:21,276 --> 09:20:25,680
register view does differently is that it creates this it basically does a call

1889
09:20:25,680 --> 09:20:30,480
to firebase that says create user with email and password

1890
09:20:30,480 --> 09:20:34,560
but if you think about it everything else is very similar

1891
09:20:34,560 --> 09:20:38,400
sorry about that so you need to create you need to make

1892
09:20:38,400 --> 09:20:41,120
sure in both of them that firebase is initialized

1893
09:20:41,120 --> 09:20:46,080
you will have two text fields email password and you will have a button one

1894
09:20:46,080 --> 09:20:50,160
for register and for one for login so

1895
09:20:50,160 --> 09:20:55,360
what we could do to be honest with you is to now go and copy this code that we

1896
09:20:55,360 --> 09:21:00,000
got from our login view okay that happens i actually forgot that

1897
09:21:00,000 --> 09:21:04,160
so let's go and copy this code again from here

1898
09:21:04,160 --> 09:21:09,360
literally get grab everything from there and put it in our login view like that

1899
09:21:09,360 --> 09:21:12,880
and change this register button to log in

1900
09:21:12,880 --> 09:21:16,960
so now we have two copies of the same view basically once it's registered the

1901
09:21:16,960 --> 09:21:21,596
other one says log in all right so

1902
09:21:21,596 --> 09:21:25,596
and what we could do is now go to our main dart file here

1903
09:21:25,596 --> 09:21:29,840
and instead of returning the register view we could just return the login view

1904
09:21:29,840 --> 09:21:34,320
because we want to work on the login view now okay we have a user registered

1905
09:21:34,320 --> 09:21:38,960
and now we need to work on login and as a side note

1906
09:21:38,960 --> 09:21:42,880
if you follow the previous chapter you'll you'll know that we actually did

1907
09:21:42,880 --> 09:21:48,720
register a a valid user with firebase and

1908
09:21:48,720 --> 09:21:52,720
what you could do is to go to your firebase console

1909
09:21:52,720 --> 09:21:56,160
as we could do now just an ad hoc i hadn't planned for this

1910
09:21:56,160 --> 09:21:59,756
but what we could do say console.firebasegoggle.com

1911
09:21:59,756 --> 09:22:02,560
ensure that you're logged in with your account

1912
09:22:02,560 --> 09:22:07,520
then i'm going to go to this uh project that we created mynotes flutter project

1913
09:22:07,520 --> 09:22:12,800
go in there and then go into authentication and you can actually then

1914
09:22:12,800 --> 09:22:18,480
see the user that you created using the flutter application that

1915
09:22:18,480 --> 09:22:23,596
you're actually working on so when you call this function in your in your

1916
09:22:23,596 --> 09:22:28,320
register view this function firebase os instance create user with

1917
09:22:28,320 --> 09:22:33,120
email and password that user was indeed created in the firebase console so here

1918
09:22:33,120 --> 09:22:37,360
you have a user you could also disable this user and do other things but we're

1919
09:22:37,360 --> 09:22:41,120
just going to leave it like that for now okay

1920
09:22:41,120 --> 09:22:45,120
so what you need to do now is instead of register view tell your home page to

1921
09:22:45,120 --> 09:22:49,040
render the login view and you could just type login view

1922
09:22:49,040 --> 09:22:53,596
and if you just type a login view like that you will get

1923
09:22:53,596 --> 09:22:57,756
an error of course because login view isn't in scope but i believe visual

1924
09:22:57,756 --> 09:23:01,520
studio code could actually help with that because you see we haven't imported

1925
09:23:01,520 --> 09:23:05,756
login view at all so this main dart file doesn't know what

1926
09:23:05,756 --> 09:23:09,276
login view is exactly the same thing happened here do

1927
09:23:09,276 --> 09:23:12,960
you remember if we didn't have these imports we got lots of errors saying

1928
09:23:12,960 --> 09:23:17,120
that they i don't know where this class is so the same thing is happening in

1929
09:23:17,120 --> 09:23:21,436
this main dart file all right so i believe in visual studio code now i'm

1930
09:23:21,436 --> 09:23:26,320
kind of improvising but i think if you set login view and just press enter boom

1931
09:23:26,320 --> 09:23:32,400
it does an import automatically for you and let's see where it is here you see

1932
09:23:32,400 --> 09:23:36,240
but if you're not comfortable doing that just type login view

1933
09:23:36,240 --> 09:23:40,560
by hand and do the same thing i showed you before just command dot on mac or

1934
09:23:40,560 --> 09:23:45,840
controlled up in windows and linux and say import okay so it's going to import

1935
09:23:45,840 --> 09:23:49,840
it for you now we have the login view and if i

1936
09:23:49,840 --> 09:23:54,320
press command s or actually we have to do a hot restart

1937
09:23:54,320 --> 09:23:59,200
you see now there is a login button right here okay

1938
09:23:59,200 --> 09:24:03,200
so what we'll need to do is as you can see in the caption now that we're

1939
09:24:03,200 --> 09:24:07,040
working on logging the login view go to your login view

1940
09:24:07,040 --> 09:24:11,520
and go here where the button is pressed you see text button unpressed

1941
09:24:11,520 --> 09:24:17,840
what we'll need to do here is to call the a new function on our firebase

1942
09:24:17,840 --> 09:24:21,916
auth instance instead of create user with email and password we're going to

1943
09:24:21,916 --> 09:24:26,000
say firebase auth got instance

1944
09:24:26,000 --> 09:24:31,916
but sign in with email and password and you can see the function signature is

1945
09:24:31,916 --> 09:24:35,596
very similar to create user with email and password in that it takes two

1946
09:24:35,596 --> 09:24:40,960
parameters namely email and password both of type string and then what it

1947
09:24:40,960 --> 09:24:46,320
does return in fact is user credential and do you remember create user with

1948
09:24:46,320 --> 09:24:49,276
email and password also return user credentials so

1949
09:24:49,276 --> 09:24:55,596
it's very simple to switch between login and register in that in that sense so

1950
09:24:55,596 --> 09:24:58,320
grab the sign in with email and password name

1951
09:24:58,320 --> 09:25:01,436
that's the only thing we're interested in and just paste it here instead of

1952
09:25:01,436 --> 09:25:06,160
create user okay just gonna save that

1953
09:25:06,160 --> 09:25:11,436
some reason my scrcpy crashed and i have no idea why

1954
09:25:11,436 --> 09:25:14,240
so that's okay that wasn't planned what we

1955
09:25:14,240 --> 09:25:18,880
could do is to go to our and i can see you see it got an aborted so what we

1956
09:25:18,880 --> 09:25:25,200
could do is to go to our terminal and i'm gonna say scr cpy okay

1957
09:25:25,200 --> 09:25:28,720
and i'm going to bring it to the screen here so

1958
09:25:28,720 --> 09:25:33,276
and also if you're if you noticed here we have a login button but the title

1959
09:25:33,276 --> 09:25:38,000
here still says register so let's go and fix that let's go into the app bar and

1960
09:25:38,000 --> 09:25:42,480
just say login all right

1961
09:25:42,480 --> 09:25:47,840
and actually problem is i can also see that my

1962
09:25:47,840 --> 09:25:54,000
as scrcpy crash also the running of this process this application on that android

1963
09:25:54,000 --> 09:25:58,480
phone also crashed so there is i mean the flutter instance of this project

1964
09:25:58,480 --> 09:26:01,276
isn't really running at the moment so what i'll have to do is to go to main

1965
09:26:01,276 --> 09:26:07,436
dart and say run without debugging so and it's now launching doing a gradle

1966
09:26:07,436 --> 09:26:12,240
build gradle remember from the previous chapters is for android

1967
09:26:12,240 --> 09:26:16,320
and if it's using xcode it is for ios all right so

1968
09:26:16,320 --> 09:26:20,400
it's doing the greater build so if everything goes according to the plan

1969
09:26:20,400 --> 09:26:25,756
then we should get a login title up there and while this is doing

1970
09:26:25,756 --> 09:26:28,880
its work i'm going to go to my notes and just ensure

1971
09:26:28,880 --> 09:26:32,840
that i've talked about the things that i promise i'm going to talk

1972
09:26:32,840 --> 09:26:37,596
about all right it's installing our application i'm gonna remove the widget

1973
09:26:37,596 --> 09:26:40,720
inspector and now you can see we have a login

1974
09:26:40,720 --> 09:26:46,560
on top and that is working as expected all right so

1975
09:26:46,560 --> 09:26:50,560
as you can see here after the logging call here sign in with email and

1976
09:26:50,560 --> 09:26:54,880
password we're doing a print now

1977
09:26:54,880 --> 09:26:59,840
what we could do here is to enter some information of a user that

1978
09:26:59,840 --> 09:27:04,800
doesn't exist okay so i'm just going to say my personal email

1979
09:27:04,800 --> 09:27:08,960
and i'm going to say foo bar path and i'm then going to bring up the

1980
09:27:08,960 --> 09:27:12,560
console here as you'll see the debug console clear it

1981
09:27:12,560 --> 09:27:16,640
um and i'm going to actually remove

1982
09:27:16,640 --> 09:27:20,320
or do something like this so you can see the debug console a little bit better in

1983
09:27:20,320 --> 09:27:25,276
its entirety and i'm going to press the login button all right

1984
09:27:25,276 --> 09:27:28,320
and then sorry about that

1985
09:27:28,320 --> 09:27:33,680
so we have now um the next thing that we need to handle as

1986
09:27:33,680 --> 09:27:35,756
you can see uh

1987
09:27:35,756 --> 09:27:40,800
i'll perhaps increase the size even more here so you'll see it better

1988
09:27:40,800 --> 09:27:44,640
when i press the login button excuse me

1989
09:27:44,640 --> 09:27:47,680
using a user

1990
09:27:47,680 --> 09:27:52,160
that doesn't exist meaning that we haven't registered that user then we got

1991
09:27:52,160 --> 09:27:57,436
an error here that says firebase off user not found and that that makes sense

1992
09:27:57,436 --> 09:28:00,720
actually completely because the

1993
09:28:00,720 --> 09:28:05,120
we haven't actually done any registration for this user okay

1994
09:28:05,120 --> 09:28:08,800
so what we could hear what we could do here

1995
09:28:08,800 --> 09:28:14,560
is to go in here and i'm gonna bring things back up

1996
09:28:14,560 --> 09:28:18,160
kind of the way they were here

1997
09:28:18,160 --> 09:28:22,320
all right so here we're recalling this function uh

1998
09:28:22,320 --> 09:28:26,160
let me decrease the size because it's absolutely ginormous

1999
09:28:26,160 --> 09:28:29,916
in here signing with email and password

2000
09:28:29,916 --> 09:28:32,800
um we need to handle

2001
09:28:32,800 --> 09:28:37,200
a thing called an exception and i don't think we talked about exceptions to be

2002
09:28:37,200 --> 09:28:40,800
honest with you while i was i was teaching you about dart if you know

2003
09:28:40,800 --> 09:28:44,320
about exceptions you could just skip through kind of skim through this little

2004
09:28:44,320 --> 09:28:48,400
bit of the video but if you're if you're not a software development developer

2005
09:28:48,400 --> 09:28:52,880
from before or software engineer then you may not know what an exception is an

2006
09:28:52,880 --> 09:28:57,276
exception is when things go wrong and you haven't kind of

2007
09:28:57,276 --> 09:29:02,640
thought about those things from the beginning so as you can as you

2008
09:29:02,640 --> 09:29:05,756
for instance if you're if you're working with

2009
09:29:05,756 --> 09:29:09,840
if you're a software if you're a designer or a product owner

2010
09:29:09,840 --> 09:29:14,240
haven't done software development before you may have also used other pieces of

2011
09:29:14,240 --> 09:29:18,720
software and sometimes software crashes just like scr cpy just crashed a few

2012
09:29:18,720 --> 09:29:22,640
minutes ago that is perhaps probably

2013
09:29:22,640 --> 09:29:26,720
an exception or an error that the software developers who created scrcpy

2014
09:29:26,720 --> 09:29:30,640
hadn't counted with so they hadn't counted with

2015
09:29:30,640 --> 09:29:33,840
that an error might occur in this scenario

2016
09:29:33,840 --> 09:29:37,276
for instance so not having handled that the application

2017
09:29:37,276 --> 09:29:41,360
crashes it means that an exception happens and error happens that the

2018
09:29:41,360 --> 09:29:45,120
developers of that program hadn't accounted for so

2019
09:29:45,120 --> 09:29:48,720
and this is an exception that you're seeing here in your flutter application

2020
09:29:48,720 --> 09:29:52,000
so firebase is saying that you're trying to log in with a user that doesn't exist

2021
09:29:52,000 --> 09:29:54,880
so what do you want to do with it i can't continue after this i don't know

2022
09:29:54,880 --> 09:29:59,520
what to do so the way to handle exceptions in

2023
09:29:59,520 --> 09:30:04,720
flutter or in dart actually is using a try catch block so i'm going to bring it

2024
09:30:04,720 --> 09:30:09,756
here put the entire code for your user credential creation in the try statement

2025
09:30:09,756 --> 09:30:14,080
as you can see here and then go in here and say catch b

2026
09:30:14,080 --> 09:30:18,400
in parenthesis for now all right just like that

2027
09:30:18,400 --> 09:30:22,640
and then i'm just gonna say something that happened

2028
09:30:22,640 --> 09:30:26,240
in single codes all right so you can see here now we

2029
09:30:26,240 --> 09:30:31,276
have a try block as indicated here with this line it's all the way from on top

2030
09:30:31,276 --> 09:30:35,596
to here and then we have a catch block the way try catch works is that it as

2031
09:30:35,596 --> 09:30:39,680
its name indicates it tries to do the work that you're saying it needs to be

2032
09:30:39,680 --> 09:30:45,520
done in the trial block should anything bad happen it will go to various catch

2033
09:30:45,520 --> 09:30:49,276
statements that you can't then place after that try okay

2034
09:30:49,276 --> 09:30:54,640
so as you saw in the logs this error

2035
09:30:54,640 --> 09:31:01,276
let's see if we can find it here it was of type firebase auth uh let me

2036
09:31:01,276 --> 09:31:07,040
see on handle exception but we didn't actually get its type unfortunately so

2037
09:31:07,040 --> 09:31:10,800
what we could do here is print something bad happen and then

2038
09:31:10,800 --> 09:31:17,040
print the error itself okay so i'm just going to say clear the logs

2039
09:31:17,040 --> 09:31:20,640
command s and then i'm going to press the login

2040
09:31:20,640 --> 09:31:24,880
again sorry here and you can see now it says

2041
09:31:24,880 --> 09:31:31,120
something bad happened firebase auth user not found and then some information

2042
09:31:31,120 --> 09:31:35,756
and we could actually say print e

2043
09:31:35,756 --> 09:31:41,276
run time type and doing that will actually give you information about

2044
09:31:41,276 --> 09:31:45,680
which class of exception this is because you see

2045
09:31:45,680 --> 09:31:49,360
as you're working with flutter and as you're working with software generally

2046
09:31:49,360 --> 09:31:52,960
you're creating software you're writing code different types of exceptions

2047
09:31:52,960 --> 09:31:57,360
happen and these exceptions have their own identity every exception has its own

2048
09:31:57,360 --> 09:32:02,400
identity it's the series of classes or different places that it may come from

2049
09:32:02,400 --> 09:32:07,120
in dart you can pretty much anything can become an error even a text

2050
09:32:07,120 --> 09:32:11,040
can become an error or enum can become an error so

2051
09:32:11,040 --> 09:32:14,480
when you come to this catch block as i'll move my mouse over it you can see

2052
09:32:14,480 --> 09:32:18,640
that here it says i don't even know what this is this is an object so

2053
09:32:18,640 --> 09:32:22,320
it could be anything but you are actually in the in your

2054
09:32:22,320 --> 09:32:26,720
cache block you're mostly interested in exceptions that might occur from

2055
09:32:26,720 --> 09:32:29,520
firebase so since we don't really know what this

2056
09:32:29,520 --> 09:32:33,276
type is we're gonna print it out to the console

2057
09:32:33,276 --> 09:32:37,436
and we're gonna have a look at what type it is so let me do

2058
09:32:37,436 --> 09:32:41,436
a little bit of them how should i do this

2059
09:32:41,436 --> 09:32:46,240
is this a little bit better arrangement perhaps so you can see what happens yeah

2060
09:32:46,240 --> 09:32:50,720
perhaps then what i'm going to do command this hot reload

2061
09:32:50,720 --> 09:32:55,436
and go here press the login button and you'll see that the type of that

2062
09:32:55,436 --> 09:32:59,680
exception is firebase auth exception all right

2063
09:32:59,680 --> 09:33:03,120
so what we need to do now is to go to our code

2064
09:33:03,120 --> 09:33:05,200
and handle

2065
09:33:05,200 --> 09:33:10,480
firebase auth exceptions not just any exception as we're doing here

2066
09:33:10,480 --> 09:33:15,520
because we're catching any exception so what we want to do is to catch firebase

2067
09:33:15,520 --> 09:33:19,680
off exceptions in our cache block all right and a way to do that is i'm going

2068
09:33:19,680 --> 09:33:25,200
to do this now and i'm going to do like we were doing

2069
09:33:25,200 --> 09:33:28,800
before get rid of the consoles to see more of the code

2070
09:33:28,800 --> 09:33:32,320
so what you could do you can have specialized cache blocks in dart and

2071
09:33:32,320 --> 09:33:37,596
that means that you are not catching everything but you tell dark that look

2072
09:33:37,596 --> 09:33:42,160
in this particular catch block i'm interested only in exceptions of this

2073
09:33:42,160 --> 09:33:45,840
type and as you might have guessed that already a

2074
09:33:45,840 --> 09:33:51,276
try block can be accompanied by more than one catch block

2075
09:33:51,276 --> 09:33:56,160
this cache block that you can see here is called catch all it catches every

2076
09:33:56,160 --> 09:34:01,436
exception that might occur in the running of the code inside the try block

2077
09:34:01,436 --> 09:34:04,560
however if you're interested in specific

2078
09:34:04,560 --> 09:34:09,360
exceptions in this case firebase auth exception i believe oh i've cleared it

2079
09:34:09,360 --> 09:34:13,680
but i think it was firebase off exception i'm going to run it again

2080
09:34:13,680 --> 09:34:17,120
go to the login button and you can see it says firebase off exception so we're

2081
09:34:17,120 --> 09:34:21,040
interested specifically in that so let's go and say tell dart that we're

2082
09:34:21,040 --> 09:34:23,596
interested in that i'm just i'm going to say on

2083
09:34:23,596 --> 09:34:28,000
firebase off exception catch

2084
09:34:28,000 --> 09:34:29,680
e all right

2085
09:34:29,680 --> 09:34:34,560
so this is the format of catching specific exceptions you prefix your

2086
09:34:34,560 --> 09:34:39,520
catch statement with the keyword on and then you write the type the runtime type

2087
09:34:39,520 --> 09:34:43,200
or the class name of the type of exception that you're interested in

2088
09:34:43,200 --> 09:34:47,436
handling all right so in this case we said on firebase off

2089
09:34:47,436 --> 09:34:51,756
the exception catchy and we're gonna remove this catch from there

2090
09:34:51,756 --> 09:34:55,916
and we're gonna go here actually i don't even have to cut and

2091
09:34:55,916 --> 09:34:59,680
what you'll need to do in here just say print e code

2092
09:34:59,680 --> 09:35:03,520
you see save this before i before i tell you

2093
09:35:03,520 --> 09:35:08,000
what i was going to say after uc let's test this let's say login and

2094
09:35:08,000 --> 09:35:11,360
you'll see that the code is used or not found

2095
09:35:11,360 --> 09:35:14,400
so now that we told dark that we're

2096
09:35:14,400 --> 09:35:19,680
specializing in catching exceptions of firebase auth exception then this e is

2097
09:35:19,680 --> 09:35:25,276
not an object anymore really let's see if we can get some help now it says okay

2098
09:35:25,276 --> 09:35:28,960
if i can catch exceptions of firebase auth exception then i know that the

2099
09:35:28,960 --> 09:35:32,480
error that i can pass to you is of that type

2100
09:35:32,480 --> 09:35:36,320
now that you catching firebase authexception you can go to this code

2101
09:35:36,320 --> 09:35:38,560
and you see there are different properties that you can read from

2102
09:35:38,560 --> 09:35:41,756
message code email credential et cetera et cetera okay

2103
09:35:41,756 --> 09:35:46,240
so we're now interested in the code so

2104
09:35:46,240 --> 09:35:49,916
as the caption right here shows at the bottom of the screen you'll see that we

2105
09:35:49,916 --> 09:35:56,000
need to handle e-code equal to user not found all right so let's say if e code

2106
09:35:56,000 --> 09:36:01,840
is equal to user not found then let's say print

2107
09:36:01,840 --> 09:36:07,436
user not found like that else e code oh sorry actually we're not going to do it

2108
09:36:07,436 --> 09:36:11,520
outside kind of like running ahead of myself a little bit there

2109
09:36:11,520 --> 09:36:15,520
so we have now um

2110
09:36:15,520 --> 09:36:18,960
e-code user not found then we're just saying print user not found okay i'm

2111
09:36:18,960 --> 09:36:23,276
going to clear the logs here go back to see our cpy here and i'm just gonna say

2112
09:36:23,276 --> 09:36:29,436
login and you'll see all it does it says user not found all right

2113
09:36:29,436 --> 09:36:32,880
so so that's that we haven't really i mean

2114
09:36:32,880 --> 09:36:37,840
the caption at the bottom left of the screen says handle but depending on your

2115
09:36:37,840 --> 09:36:42,240
um background you may expect handle to do different things for

2116
09:36:42,240 --> 09:36:45,436
a software for a seasoned software engineer handle may actually mean that

2117
09:36:45,436 --> 09:36:50,160
well do something about it okay tell him tell the user like oh i couldn't log in

2118
09:36:50,160 --> 09:36:54,160
the user couldn't be found or whatever reason just show something to

2119
09:36:54,160 --> 09:36:57,840
the user and we could do that but at the moment we don't have the capacity to do

2120
09:36:57,840 --> 09:37:00,640
that we don't really know how to handle that so

2121
09:37:00,640 --> 09:37:06,480
what we need to do then is to simply say print so we just print it to the screen

2122
09:37:06,480 --> 09:37:10,320
so this is our handling for now okay it's very simple all it does is just

2123
09:37:10,320 --> 09:37:14,480
ensures that no exception is thrown to the user's face or that the application

2124
09:37:14,480 --> 09:37:18,080
doesn't crash

2125
09:37:18,080 --> 09:37:23,840
okay that was a lot of information um now as the caption here shows in the

2126
09:37:23,840 --> 09:37:27,596
login view we also need to handle wrong password

2127
09:37:27,596 --> 09:37:33,360
and i mean as you can see here the e code is a string so anything here could

2128
09:37:33,360 --> 09:37:38,800
happen that could be defined by string and one other

2129
09:37:38,800 --> 09:37:43,276
excuse me one of those errors actually is wrong

2130
09:37:43,276 --> 09:37:48,640
password so let's test that in here let's say else if if the code is

2131
09:37:48,640 --> 09:37:54,480
not user not found just print something else happened

2132
09:37:54,480 --> 09:37:59,436
and then print the errors code to the screen okay

2133
09:37:59,436 --> 09:38:05,596
so i'm going to save this and i'm going to then go here and then

2134
09:38:05,596 --> 09:38:09,520
actually change this email to an existing email which was the one that i

2135
09:38:09,520 --> 09:38:13,680
registered and password i believe was foobar or

2136
09:38:13,680 --> 09:38:16,960
something clickfu bar maybe

2137
09:38:16,960 --> 09:38:20,480
and i'm going to say login and you can see here it says now something else

2138
09:38:20,480 --> 09:38:25,120
happened wrong password so that could that could kind of mean that

2139
09:38:25,120 --> 09:38:28,400
well yeah actually that isn't my password this foo bar was in my password

2140
09:38:28,400 --> 09:38:31,276
i don't even remember what it was maybe it was full bar bass

2141
09:38:31,276 --> 09:38:35,200
but that is great it says something else happen an e code and that's exactly what

2142
09:38:35,200 --> 09:38:38,640
we have to sorry about that

2143
09:38:38,640 --> 09:38:43,520
and that is exactly what we need to handle here um wrong password so in your

2144
09:38:43,520 --> 09:38:48,080
else statement say else if e code

2145
09:38:48,080 --> 09:38:52,480
is wrong password

2146
09:38:52,480 --> 09:38:56,800
then we're going to say print wrong password

2147
09:38:56,800 --> 09:38:59,916
okay man is

2148
09:38:59,916 --> 09:39:05,040
so that's there clear the logs i'm going to say log in and you'll see the message

2149
09:39:05,040 --> 09:39:09,436
wrong password printed to the screen

2150
09:39:09,436 --> 09:39:13,520
all right a lot of work

2151
09:39:13,520 --> 09:39:17,040
we've done quite a lot of work now in the login view but we haven't really put

2152
09:39:17,040 --> 09:39:22,160
much energy into the register view you see they're very similar in that they do

2153
09:39:22,160 --> 09:39:25,360
almost the same api calls with the email and password ones that sign in the other

2154
09:39:25,360 --> 09:39:29,596
ones that's register however in if if we go to our main dart

2155
09:39:29,596 --> 09:39:34,800
file you'll see in here in our register view we're just calling the api and kind

2156
09:39:34,800 --> 09:39:38,720
of like hoping for the best there's no try catch statement here okay so what we

2157
09:39:38,720 --> 09:39:43,680
could do is have a look at how we did it for login we put the api call inside the

2158
09:39:43,680 --> 09:39:48,480
try block you see what we need to do is to go to main dart and for our register

2159
09:39:48,480 --> 09:39:51,596
view here register view state do the same

2160
09:39:51,596 --> 09:39:57,520
thing let's put this in a try block here

2161
09:39:57,520 --> 09:40:01,040
okay and then just say catch or say on

2162
09:40:01,040 --> 09:40:05,120
firebase off exception

2163
09:40:05,120 --> 09:40:08,000
this is i mean i'm not going to explain this again because it's exactly what we

2164
09:40:08,000 --> 09:40:12,720
did just in the login view i believe firebase authexception didn't

2165
09:40:12,720 --> 09:40:17,360
really exist in this in this dart file before but that is what visual studio

2166
09:40:17,360 --> 09:40:21,436
code helped me with as i typed it and pressed enter for auto completion

2167
09:40:21,436 --> 09:40:25,276
then it must have been imported somewhere

2168
09:40:25,276 --> 09:40:30,320
or it was probably part of firebase auth dart i believe actually so if i command

2169
09:40:30,320 --> 09:40:34,400
click on it it goes to firebase auth so that's why i

2170
09:40:34,400 --> 09:40:37,120
it probably didn't have to import anything because it was already imported

2171
09:40:37,120 --> 09:40:42,000
as a part of firebase auth okay

2172
09:40:42,000 --> 09:40:45,200
oh wow that was a lot of information also

2173
09:40:45,200 --> 09:40:49,040
now that we're working on the register view let's go to our main

2174
09:40:49,040 --> 09:40:53,276
dar main function here and since we're only seeing the login view let's switch

2175
09:40:53,276 --> 09:40:58,320
this back to register view and command s but this is not going to

2176
09:40:58,320 --> 09:41:01,840
change anything as you remember hot reload doesn't have an effect of any

2177
09:41:01,840 --> 09:41:05,360
changes that you it doesn't have an effect on anything that you're changing

2178
09:41:05,360 --> 09:41:08,960
the main function remember that you have to hot restart okay

2179
09:41:08,960 --> 09:41:13,200
so hot restart now we're in the register view

2180
09:41:13,200 --> 09:41:19,276
and we need to now handle wrong password uh actually

2181
09:41:19,276 --> 09:41:24,000
no that's not the login sorry about that now we need to handle

2182
09:41:24,000 --> 09:41:27,916
this weak password so

2183
09:41:27,916 --> 09:41:32,800
as you're working with uh firebase zoom you will notice that it has its own set

2184
09:41:32,800 --> 09:41:36,880
of security rules you also can override these security rules later for your

2185
09:41:36,880 --> 09:41:40,640
server if you want to for instance you can expect or you can say all my users

2186
09:41:40,640 --> 09:41:46,320
have to have passwords that are 18 um characters long and a mixture of digits

2187
09:41:46,320 --> 09:41:49,520
and alpha numerical values etcetera etcetera but

2188
09:41:49,520 --> 09:41:53,756
there are some default security rules set up on firebase

2189
09:41:53,756 --> 09:41:58,880
for credentials that every user needs to abide by so let's actually have a look

2190
09:41:58,880 --> 09:42:01,436
at that and let's

2191
09:42:01,436 --> 09:42:05,680
do a print here and i'm going to say print e

2192
09:42:05,680 --> 09:42:08,960
code okay and as you'll see in the caption as you

2193
09:42:08,960 --> 09:42:13,200
are seeing in the caption there is an e code of equal to weak password that

2194
09:42:13,200 --> 09:42:17,200
needs to be handled so i'm going to go here try to register user with my

2195
09:42:17,200 --> 09:42:22,240
personal email and the password of a b c all right then i'm going to bring up

2196
09:42:22,240 --> 09:42:24,480
the console clear the console a little bit

2197
09:42:24,480 --> 09:42:27,360
i'm going to do this so you'll see it a little bit better

2198
09:42:27,360 --> 09:42:34,400
then i'm gonna try to register with a password of abc press register

2199
09:42:34,400 --> 09:42:38,880
what happened here you see the code was weak password

2200
09:42:38,880 --> 09:42:43,040
and as you'll expect yeah weak password that is too weak a password to even be

2201
09:42:43,040 --> 09:42:48,160
used anywhere so um

2202
09:42:48,160 --> 09:42:52,480
so what we need to do here is to handle the weak password

2203
09:42:52,480 --> 09:42:57,520
error basically i'm gonna take in my notes that i've talked about some other

2204
09:42:57,520 --> 09:43:02,400
topics of login all right so we'll handle weak password

2205
09:43:02,400 --> 09:43:06,400
the way we handle the other errors in login view

2206
09:43:06,400 --> 09:43:10,640
then say if e code is equal to

2207
09:43:10,640 --> 09:43:14,240
weak password

2208
09:43:14,240 --> 09:43:19,680
and let's just say print week password okay

2209
09:43:19,680 --> 09:43:23,916
and we'll say um so that's that's that for now okay

2210
09:43:23,916 --> 09:43:30,160
and i'm going to just bring up the um debug console again

2211
09:43:30,160 --> 09:43:32,800
and press the register button one more time

2212
09:43:32,800 --> 09:43:37,200
now you'll see the information let me bring it so you can actually see it

2213
09:43:37,200 --> 09:43:42,160
yeah you can actually see it great you can see weak password being printed here

2214
09:43:42,160 --> 09:43:46,640
all right so that was great now let's go let me bring the let make

2215
09:43:46,640 --> 09:43:50,960
the screen a little bit bigger the next thing we have to handle

2216
09:43:50,960 --> 09:43:56,560
is um in this register view as you can see in the caption here

2217
09:43:56,560 --> 09:44:00,640
you can also get an error called email already in use so if you go to the else

2218
09:44:00,640 --> 09:44:03,436
statement here again and print e

2219
09:44:03,436 --> 09:44:08,160
if i try to register with the same email that i registered before

2220
09:44:08,160 --> 09:44:12,560
this user already exists and if even if i have quite a good password for this

2221
09:44:12,560 --> 09:44:16,840
user so i'm going to say fubar bass

2222
09:44:16,840 --> 09:44:20,000
1029. so we know that the error is not going

2223
09:44:20,000 --> 09:44:23,596
to be the password like it's actually a good password well

2224
09:44:23,596 --> 09:44:28,720
better than fubar baz at least and that or abc so i'm just going to say register

2225
09:44:28,720 --> 09:44:31,120
and

2226
09:44:31,120 --> 09:44:36,160
do we not get any value here or did i even press the register button

2227
09:44:36,160 --> 09:44:39,436
is it really registering pixelity a b

2228
09:44:39,436 --> 09:44:42,560
no i don't think so um

2229
09:44:42,560 --> 09:44:48,640
oh i hadn't saved the file oops so yeah i haven't saved my changes i'm gonna say

2230
09:44:48,640 --> 09:44:52,880
register oh now it says email already in use and

2231
09:44:52,880 --> 09:44:55,756
that is exactly i mean that is pretty much what we have to handle right

2232
09:44:55,756 --> 09:45:00,960
because we're printing e so um i didn't have to say oh no surprises

2233
09:45:00,960 --> 09:45:05,120
there so let's handle email already and use so

2234
09:45:05,120 --> 09:45:08,880
i'm going to copy this email already and use string just exactly as it's

2235
09:45:08,880 --> 09:45:12,320
mentioned here and i'm going to go to else and say

2236
09:45:12,320 --> 09:45:18,880
else if e code is equal to that string and then say uh email is

2237
09:45:18,880 --> 09:45:22,960
already in use okay

2238
09:45:22,960 --> 09:45:27,840
and then save it there clear the logs press the register button

2239
09:45:27,840 --> 09:45:34,160
again you can see now it says email is already in use okay

2240
09:45:34,160 --> 09:45:36,240
so um

2241
09:45:36,240 --> 09:45:41,200
let me also have a little bit of a look at my notes

2242
09:45:41,200 --> 09:45:44,480
um

2243
09:45:44,480 --> 09:45:48,640
i can also i mean to be honest with you in the notes i don't see anywhere

2244
09:45:48,640 --> 09:45:54,880
that we're really trying to handle uh these errors like actually doing

2245
09:45:54,880 --> 09:45:59,916
something about them all right so

2246
09:45:59,916 --> 09:46:04,560
perhaps a better thing to do would be

2247
09:46:04,560 --> 09:46:09,276
to really like show a message or something to the user

2248
09:46:09,276 --> 09:46:13,756
and i'm kind of wondering that right now like whether that's a good idea or a bad

2249
09:46:13,756 --> 09:46:18,640
idea for this chapter and perhaps just doing a print will suffice to be honest

2250
09:46:18,640 --> 09:46:22,640
with you not entirely sure about that so

2251
09:46:22,640 --> 09:46:27,916
um let's leave it at that for now okay i'm also gonna go here and make sure

2252
09:46:27,916 --> 09:46:32,400
that i'm not yeah i'm in do not disturb so let's leave it leave it at that email

2253
09:46:32,400 --> 09:46:36,560
already use perfect okay let's leave it at that

2254
09:46:36,560 --> 09:46:38,400
now the next thing that we have to handle

2255
09:46:38,400 --> 09:46:42,800
it could also write a situation where the user tries to enter an invalid email

2256
09:46:42,800 --> 09:46:46,400
all right so let's put an else statement here and say print

2257
09:46:46,400 --> 09:46:50,320
um e code again save it

2258
09:46:50,320 --> 09:46:55,040
let's go and remove this add sign so it becomes an invalid email and try to

2259
09:46:55,040 --> 09:47:00,640
press the register button okay now you can see uh you can't actually see now

2260
09:47:00,640 --> 09:47:05,120
you can see at the bottom in the logs it says invalid email and that is the code

2261
09:47:05,120 --> 09:47:10,800
for that error so let's handle invalid email now all right

2262
09:47:10,800 --> 09:47:16,800
so i'm going to go here and say else if e code we call to invalid email then

2263
09:47:16,800 --> 09:47:22,160
we're going to say print invalid email entered all right and save it

2264
09:47:22,160 --> 09:47:26,400
so clear the logs tap the register button and now you'll

2265
09:47:26,400 --> 09:47:31,840
see invalid email entered okay so

2266
09:47:31,840 --> 09:47:35,680
i mean that's really um all we have to do

2267
09:47:35,680 --> 09:47:40,640
right now for our error handling and as we're going on i

2268
09:47:40,640 --> 09:47:42,880
mean to be honest with you i still have a little bit of time to figure out

2269
09:47:42,880 --> 09:47:46,800
whether we're really going to handle these things by and by that i mean like

2270
09:47:46,800 --> 09:47:50,320
if we are if we need to display some some error to

2271
09:47:50,320 --> 09:47:56,560
the user okay and we may need to do that but it is a little bit complicated like

2272
09:47:56,560 --> 09:47:59,680
depending on how we want to handle it do we want to show like a message to the

2273
09:47:59,680 --> 09:48:03,276
user do you want to show a toast to the user um

2274
09:48:03,276 --> 09:48:06,400
or do we want to like display another screen to the user and that's kind of

2275
09:48:06,400 --> 09:48:10,880
like unclear even to me right now so maybe we'll iron these things out then

2276
09:48:10,880 --> 09:48:16,640
as we go on in in the upcoming chapters as well

2277
09:48:16,640 --> 09:48:19,276
so

2278
09:48:19,276 --> 09:48:24,000
now i can see here that login

2279
09:48:24,000 --> 09:48:28,480
we've talked about that and what we need to do then

2280
09:48:28,480 --> 09:48:34,720
in order to be able to carry on with the upcoming chapters

2281
09:48:34,720 --> 09:48:40,800
is actually to make sure that we are logged in to the application you see

2282
09:48:40,800 --> 09:48:44,640
we've worked on the register view we've worked on the login view

2283
09:48:44,640 --> 09:48:48,400
we're trying like so many different combinations here to register new user

2284
09:48:48,400 --> 09:48:51,520
login so i personally don't know at the moment whether

2285
09:48:51,520 --> 09:48:56,640
this application firebase instance actually has a logged in user and if

2286
09:48:56,640 --> 09:49:01,276
you're familiar with like python django or flask or if you're doing nodejs or

2287
09:49:01,276 --> 09:49:04,400
whatever development like backend development

2288
09:49:04,400 --> 09:49:09,040
you can be a logged in user but still end up being in a login view

2289
09:49:09,040 --> 09:49:14,240
so if you send a login login user to a login view doesn't mean that the user

2290
09:49:14,240 --> 09:49:17,680
isn't logged in instead it means well that user is

2291
09:49:17,680 --> 09:49:22,080
logged in but may want to log in as a different user so that is the case in

2292
09:49:22,080 --> 09:49:25,520
our application as well we have a register screen a login view but i

2293
09:49:25,520 --> 09:49:28,960
personally don't know what the state of the application at the moment is are we

2294
09:49:28,960 --> 09:49:32,080
logged in or are we not logged in because we're kind of like playing with

2295
09:49:32,080 --> 09:49:37,200
different views here okay so that's very important now because in the

2296
09:49:37,200 --> 09:49:42,080
next chapter i can see in chapter 14 we are going to work with

2297
09:49:42,080 --> 09:49:45,276
um we're working on separating the app

2298
09:49:45,276 --> 09:49:48,640
initialization from the login and register screens because you can see at

2299
09:49:48,640 --> 09:49:52,560
the moment we have this future builder that is

2300
09:49:52,560 --> 09:49:57,120
initializing firebase and it is doing lots of work comes with snapshots stay

2301
09:49:57,120 --> 09:50:01,276
done blah blah and we're doing the exact same thing in two views login view and

2302
09:50:01,276 --> 09:50:04,400
the register view so what we need to do is kind of like

2303
09:50:04,400 --> 09:50:07,520
separate that logic and ensure that we display the correct

2304
09:50:07,520 --> 09:50:11,276
view depending on yeah what the state of the application is and before we can

2305
09:50:11,276 --> 09:50:15,276
then continue or start that chapter we kind of need to make sure that the user

2306
09:50:15,276 --> 09:50:22,000
the current user is logged in all right so let's go to our um

2307
09:50:22,000 --> 09:50:27,040
main dart here and login logged in views already displayed so i don't really you

2308
09:50:27,040 --> 09:50:30,960
don't need to worry about this part import login view

2309
09:50:30,960 --> 09:50:36,000
what you need to do now is to make sure that instead of register view we're

2310
09:50:36,000 --> 09:50:39,840
displaying the login view and remember now we're saving something

2311
09:50:39,840 --> 09:50:44,160
changing something in the main function so hot reload isn't going to

2312
09:50:44,160 --> 09:50:50,000
work so you need to do hot restart so we'll get to that login view

2313
09:50:50,000 --> 09:50:55,840
and let's then enter valid details here so i'm going to say pixelityab.gmail.com

2314
09:50:55,840 --> 09:51:00,720
and i think the password was fubar best to be honest

2315
09:51:00,720 --> 09:51:06,000
i'm going to press the login button all right and there we got the

2316
09:51:06,000 --> 09:51:12,240
credentials for this user wow that was a lot of information and i

2317
09:51:12,240 --> 09:51:16,960
understand that um so what we need to work on now i'm going

2318
09:51:16,960 --> 09:51:21,276
to take some stuff in my notes is

2319
09:51:21,276 --> 09:51:25,200
as i mentioned we need to for the next chapter i mean we're kind of done with

2320
09:51:25,200 --> 09:51:28,720
this chapter to be honest we've talked a lot about like exception handling

2321
09:51:28,720 --> 09:51:32,240
separated the login view from the register view but our register view is

2322
09:51:32,240 --> 09:51:35,276
still in the main dart we're gonna we're gonna

2323
09:51:35,276 --> 09:51:39,120
fix that soon but what you need to know to do before

2324
09:51:39,120 --> 09:51:42,080
you continue with the next chapter and just ensure that you're displaying the

2325
09:51:42,080 --> 09:51:46,640
login view to the user and that you're actually logging logging in with a valid

2326
09:51:46,640 --> 09:51:51,680
username and password this ensures that the firebase instance that is running in

2327
09:51:51,680 --> 09:51:56,960
this application right now is going to cache that information locally on ios is

2328
09:51:56,960 --> 09:52:01,596
going to cache that information in a secure storage called keychain and on

2329
09:52:01,596 --> 09:52:05,360
android i think it's called shared preferences or something like that

2330
09:52:05,360 --> 09:52:09,520
so that information is going to be securely stored now on that telephone

2331
09:52:09,520 --> 09:52:13,360
which for me is an android telephone right here and

2332
09:52:13,360 --> 09:52:17,040
when i restart the application whenever if i like shut down my

2333
09:52:17,040 --> 09:52:21,040
telephone restart the telephone the os come back up that information is already

2334
09:52:21,040 --> 09:52:25,756
saved on that telephone so my user is logged in all right

2335
09:52:25,756 --> 09:52:29,360
so just ensure that before you continue with the next chapter that you've

2336
09:52:29,360 --> 09:52:33,200
registered the user first and that you've logged in with that user from

2337
09:52:33,200 --> 09:52:38,800
your application so that information is cached inside the application all right

2338
09:52:38,800 --> 09:52:43,436
good a lot of information in the next chapter

2339
09:52:43,436 --> 09:52:48,480
we're going to separate the app initialization from the login and the

2340
09:52:48,480 --> 09:52:53,040
register screens there are only a few steps that we have to do

2341
09:52:53,040 --> 09:52:58,560
in that chapter so

2342
09:52:58,560 --> 09:53:02,720
so i don't think that chapter is going to actually be so long

2343
09:53:02,720 --> 09:53:07,756
so grab a cup of tea coffee whatever you want chocolate or whatever it is and

2344
09:53:07,756 --> 09:53:13,040
i will see you in the next chapter hello and welcome to chapter number 14

2345
09:53:13,040 --> 09:53:16,240
of our flutter course as you saw in the previous chapter we

2346
09:53:16,240 --> 09:53:21,916
worked on the login view now we have a login view and a register view in place

2347
09:53:21,916 --> 09:53:25,916
and what you also saw is that we did some very simple

2348
09:53:25,916 --> 09:53:29,360
error handling for various scenarios such as

2349
09:53:29,360 --> 09:53:34,560
uh email address already registered weak password um

2350
09:53:34,560 --> 09:53:38,720
invalid email incorrect password or wrong password i

2351
09:53:38,720 --> 09:53:42,880
think it was called so now we have two views in place

2352
09:53:42,880 --> 09:53:47,360
um we have but we have two main issues to address here

2353
09:53:47,360 --> 09:53:50,720
the registration or the register view that

2354
09:53:50,720 --> 09:53:55,596
we created still lives in our

2355
09:53:55,596 --> 09:54:00,000
main.dart file and the other issue is as the caption

2356
09:54:00,000 --> 09:54:04,880
here displays is that the widgets are doing app initialization

2357
09:54:04,880 --> 09:54:09,276
if you remember from the code there was this firebase initialization

2358
09:54:09,276 --> 09:54:13,200
api invocation that we had to do and since

2359
09:54:13,200 --> 09:54:17,200
the login view and the register view are very similar to each other they're both

2360
09:54:17,200 --> 09:54:21,360
doing the initialization of firebase

2361
09:54:21,360 --> 09:54:24,000
what we're going to do in this chapter is

2362
09:54:24,000 --> 09:54:28,320
separate these um initializations and

2363
09:54:28,320 --> 09:54:32,400
make them one that's that's the first first thing we need to do so we just

2364
09:54:32,400 --> 09:54:35,040
have one initialization that's going to happen

2365
09:54:35,040 --> 09:54:38,960
and what we're also going to do is to bring the register view in its own file

2366
09:54:38,960 --> 09:54:42,960
so this this chapter is going to be a quick one unlike the other chapters and

2367
09:54:42,960 --> 09:54:46,080
i think that's kind of refreshing to be honest with you otherwise all chapters

2368
09:54:46,080 --> 09:54:49,680
are going to be very long and very detailed

2369
09:54:49,680 --> 09:54:55,360
so with that said let's then um

2370
09:54:55,360 --> 09:54:59,596
let's then start with the first thing we have to do

2371
09:54:59,596 --> 09:55:02,640
which is basically to move the register view into

2372
09:55:02,640 --> 09:55:05,840
views register view okay i'm going to see if i can bring up

2373
09:55:05,840 --> 09:55:10,640
visual studio code um how we had left it before

2374
09:55:10,640 --> 09:55:15,276
and i'm going to bring up scrcpy which

2375
09:55:15,276 --> 09:55:19,680
is my android phone running our flutter application right now

2376
09:55:19,680 --> 09:55:24,000
so let's do as the caption says here i'm going to make the screen a little bit

2377
09:55:24,000 --> 09:55:28,480
bigger so you can see better then go to your project uh or explorer

2378
09:55:28,480 --> 09:55:31,436
here visual studio core if you're using android studio you can go go to the

2379
09:55:31,436 --> 09:55:34,960
navigator there as well there's a similar one in android studio or if

2380
09:55:34,960 --> 09:55:38,720
you're using sublime that is exactly the same thing here on the left hand side

2381
09:55:38,720 --> 09:55:43,596
you can see the project structure then go to lib and then views as we have

2382
09:55:43,596 --> 09:55:47,276
the login view there let's create a view called register view so right click here

2383
09:55:47,276 --> 09:55:53,200
and say new file and i'm going to say register mu dot dart

2384
09:55:53,200 --> 09:55:58,960
okay so then we have to as the question says go back to our main dart file and

2385
09:55:58,960 --> 09:56:03,756
grab this register view from here group all the register view including

2386
09:56:03,756 --> 09:56:08,320
its register view state grab all of that

2387
09:56:08,320 --> 09:56:12,800
cut it in mac you do it with command x and in windows and linux i think you do

2388
09:56:12,800 --> 09:56:16,960
control x so um i cut that and i'm gonna then bring

2389
09:56:16,960 --> 09:56:21,200
it into register view here as you saw in the previous chapter doing

2390
09:56:21,200 --> 09:56:23,840
these things usually cause a lot of headache

2391
09:56:23,840 --> 09:56:27,520
for for your editor because i mean it's not

2392
09:56:27,520 --> 09:56:30,400
a headache for you because we can easily fix it for us it's not a problem but

2393
09:56:30,400 --> 09:56:32,960
it's just the editor that doesn't understand where all these classes are

2394
09:56:32,960 --> 09:56:36,960
located at so i i've explained this previously in

2395
09:56:36,960 --> 09:56:40,400
the exact previous chapter before this so i'm not going to explain it again so

2396
09:56:40,400 --> 09:56:44,800
let's say command dot in visual studio code and then say import material to fix

2397
09:56:44,800 --> 09:56:48,480
all the stateful widget problems and all the things that all the classes are

2398
09:56:48,480 --> 09:56:53,040
stored in material dart here in the flotter package okay

2399
09:56:53,040 --> 09:56:55,596
then we have other problems such as firebase so

2400
09:56:55,596 --> 09:57:01,756
command dot import firebase core to fix that command dot import firebase options

2401
09:57:01,756 --> 09:57:05,360
here it's that problem and we will also have

2402
09:57:05,360 --> 09:57:11,200
to import firebase off i believe and that is also fixed all right so now we

2403
09:57:11,200 --> 09:57:14,800
have a register view here perfect and um

2404
09:57:14,800 --> 09:57:19,520
if you see here in our main dart now there are lots of things that are

2405
09:57:19,520 --> 09:57:23,596
imported which aren't which aren't needed anymore

2406
09:57:23,596 --> 09:57:28,160
so let's remove those you can see these things are actually

2407
09:57:28,160 --> 09:57:32,080
you may say okay well how do i find all these problems like there's lots of

2408
09:57:32,080 --> 09:57:35,596
issues here but had i not come back to the main dart file i wouldn't have seen

2409
09:57:35,596 --> 09:57:39,916
them and the way to fix that is to actually bring up your

2410
09:57:39,916 --> 09:57:44,720
problems view here and you'll see that there are lots of problems stated that

2411
09:57:44,720 --> 09:57:49,120
you can go go and fix those you see print statements are here and then

2412
09:57:49,120 --> 09:57:54,240
unused imports which you can which you can clean up as well so

2413
09:57:54,240 --> 09:57:57,680
that's how you can use the problems window

2414
09:57:57,680 --> 09:58:02,640
i'm going to do that by hand now remove this and remove this so we have a clean

2415
09:58:02,640 --> 09:58:06,160
void main function here all right i'm gonna do a hot restart just to make sure

2416
09:58:06,160 --> 09:58:12,240
everything's working as expected then we have the login view here okay

2417
09:58:12,240 --> 09:58:18,560
so the next thing we need to do now is as the notes i'm actually going to go to

2418
09:58:18,560 --> 09:58:22,560
my notes and make sure that i have talked about the previous point

2419
09:58:22,560 --> 09:58:26,960
so the next thing we need to do is to create a dedicated home page that does

2420
09:58:26,960 --> 09:58:32,080
the app initialization and depending on whether the user is logged in or logged

2421
09:58:32,080 --> 09:58:35,916
out or if the user is verified or not then it's going to display the correct

2422
09:58:35,916 --> 09:58:40,000
widget on the screen okay so just to explain that a little bit more

2423
09:58:40,000 --> 09:58:45,120
is that i mean you i can say that you see in your main function here that

2424
09:58:45,120 --> 09:58:48,640
when your application run you it runs you're telling it to go to login view

2425
09:58:48,640 --> 09:58:52,320
but why why are we saying go to login view

2426
09:58:52,320 --> 09:58:57,520
why are we saying go to register view we have no logic at the moment that says

2427
09:58:57,520 --> 09:59:01,200
are you logged in then show the login view or if you're not like me and show

2428
09:59:01,200 --> 09:59:04,080
the registry so that's what we're going to do with our

2429
09:59:04,080 --> 09:59:08,400
home page okay so imagine the home page kind of being the manager of the

2430
09:59:08,400 --> 09:59:13,200
different routes that your application can manage so saying that oh if this

2431
09:59:13,200 --> 09:59:18,000
condition then do this if that condition display the other screen so

2432
09:59:18,000 --> 09:59:23,120
we need a home page and conveniently named is home page i mean lots of other

2433
09:59:23,120 --> 09:59:27,596
people may try to call it something else like a route page or whatever

2434
09:59:27,596 --> 09:59:30,640
but for now we're going to go with homepage because it's just so easy to

2435
09:59:30,640 --> 09:59:35,360
understand for everyone so let's then go in here

2436
09:59:35,360 --> 09:59:40,160
and say we want to have a stateless widget stl and we're going

2437
09:59:40,160 --> 09:59:44,560
to call it home page okay and i'm gonna press escape after that so now we have a

2438
09:59:44,560 --> 09:59:50,080
stateless widget called home page in our main dart file

2439
09:59:50,080 --> 09:59:54,880
now what we need to do then after doing that

2440
09:59:54,880 --> 09:59:59,680
we need to go in our main dart file and instead of saying login view let's just

2441
09:59:59,680 --> 10:00:03,840
say home page okay and if i press command is remember this is not going to

2442
10:00:03,840 --> 10:00:07,596
take any effect immediately because hot reload doesn't take into consideration

2443
10:00:07,596 --> 10:00:10,640
it changes the main function here so you have to do a hot restart so you'll see

2444
10:00:10,640 --> 10:00:13,840
black screen right now okay so

2445
10:00:13,840 --> 10:00:16,640
that's that

2446
10:00:16,640 --> 10:00:20,720
so what we need to do now is

2447
10:00:20,720 --> 10:00:24,240
to basically have some scaffold in our

2448
10:00:24,240 --> 10:00:27,120
homepage because we don't want to display just an empty screen to the user

2449
10:00:27,120 --> 10:00:28,880
okay so

2450
10:00:28,880 --> 10:00:34,480
let's go in here for our container instead say we return a scaffold

2451
10:00:34,480 --> 10:00:37,916
talked about scaffold in previous chapters so i'm not going to explain

2452
10:00:37,916 --> 10:00:42,320
that again and let's go and create an app bar with

2453
10:00:42,320 --> 10:00:48,080
which we've also talked about title accounts text and say home page

2454
10:00:48,080 --> 10:00:50,480
okay

2455
10:00:50,480 --> 10:00:55,436
well command s in mac or control s in linux and windows to save this file and

2456
10:00:55,436 --> 10:01:00,480
you'll see the changes took effect immediately

2457
10:01:00,480 --> 10:01:04,720
all right so what do we need in the home page we said

2458
10:01:04,720 --> 10:01:10,160
that the home page needs to initialize firebase it needs to first do that so

2459
10:01:10,160 --> 10:01:14,880
that we can get rid of this code in both register view you see this code future

2460
10:01:14,880 --> 10:01:19,200
builder firebase initialize app and then connection state done blah blah and also

2461
10:01:19,200 --> 10:01:22,640
we have the exact same code in our login view so

2462
10:01:22,640 --> 10:01:26,640
there's a lot of code to write in every view that we're gonna develop though

2463
10:01:26,640 --> 10:01:29,520
this application isn't gonna have so many views maybe six seven views but

2464
10:01:29,520 --> 10:01:34,400
still we don't wanna do initialize app in every view and do a future builder

2465
10:01:34,400 --> 10:01:38,880
it's just a lot of code so that's what our

2466
10:01:38,880 --> 10:01:46,640
homepage is gonna do okay so let's do that uh let's go and grab

2467
10:01:46,640 --> 10:01:51,520
this code um excuse me

2468
10:01:51,520 --> 10:01:55,680
let's grab this code with the future builder pretty much maybe the entire

2469
10:01:55,680 --> 10:02:00,560
build function okay from our login view so go to your login view grab the entire

2470
10:02:00,560 --> 10:02:06,160
build function until its end which is here this parenthesis okay ending

2471
10:02:06,160 --> 10:02:08,480
parenthesis close your login view close your

2472
10:02:08,480 --> 10:02:13,360
register view if you want to then go and replace the entire override of widget

2473
10:02:13,360 --> 10:02:18,400
build in your home page with that code that you just cut or

2474
10:02:18,400 --> 10:02:22,000
sorry copied from the login view paste it right here

2475
10:02:22,000 --> 10:02:26,880
now we we don't want the home page to have any logic that has anything to do

2476
10:02:26,880 --> 10:02:29,120
with um

2477
10:02:29,120 --> 10:02:33,916
text fields this homepage is we're going to use it for something a lot more noble

2478
10:02:33,916 --> 10:02:37,916
so you don't need all the text fields and

2479
10:02:37,916 --> 10:02:41,680
and all of these columns and uh your text

2480
10:02:41,680 --> 10:02:45,360
button so go to here where you're creating the

2481
10:02:45,360 --> 10:02:50,800
column in connection state done and grab that code all the way from

2482
10:02:50,800 --> 10:02:54,880
return so if i fold it you'll see that that is the entire return and i'm going

2483
10:02:54,880 --> 10:02:58,240
to actually delete it oops it didn't delete the entire code

2484
10:02:58,240 --> 10:03:00,800
okay so i'm going to do it by hand from the return

2485
10:03:00,800 --> 10:03:05,756
all the way down here to where the

2486
10:03:05,756 --> 10:03:09,436
column ends okay

2487
10:03:09,436 --> 10:03:13,040
and instead of that column what we're gonna do

2488
10:03:13,040 --> 10:03:18,560
is just return a text that says

2489
10:03:18,560 --> 10:03:22,320
okay just like that so if firebase

2490
10:03:22,320 --> 10:03:26,480
initialization is done it's just gonna say done and let's also change the text

2491
10:03:26,480 --> 10:03:30,000
here and just call it home all right now that we've done that you can see we

2492
10:03:30,000 --> 10:03:33,120
still have some problems with firebase not being imported because i deleted

2493
10:03:33,120 --> 10:03:35,520
those um um

2494
10:03:35,520 --> 10:03:39,756
imports previously so i'm gonna fix that now command dot on firebase and say

2495
10:03:39,756 --> 10:03:44,080
import that and command dot on default firebase options or control dot

2496
10:03:44,080 --> 10:03:49,680
depending on whether on your linux whether if you're on linux or a mac or

2497
10:03:49,680 --> 10:03:54,480
windows import firebase options

2498
10:03:54,480 --> 10:03:57,680
all right so now you'll see we have a homepage that just displays the word

2499
10:03:57,680 --> 10:04:01,596
done here once the connection state of our future

2500
10:04:01,596 --> 10:04:06,320
which is initialized app of firebase is actually done so hot reload

2501
10:04:06,320 --> 10:04:11,520
and you'll see hotdog sorry done is also displayed hot done

2502
10:04:11,520 --> 10:04:14,160
um so uh

2503
10:04:14,160 --> 10:04:18,480
i'm gonna take that in my notes that i've talked about that

2504
10:04:18,480 --> 10:04:21,200
all right the next thing we need to do in this

2505
10:04:21,200 --> 10:04:26,480
chapter is um to make sure that the user is not null

2506
10:04:26,480 --> 10:04:32,080
and that also the user is verified so under some rare circumstances with

2507
10:04:32,080 --> 10:04:36,000
firebase such as when you haven't initialized your firebase application

2508
10:04:36,000 --> 10:04:42,000
using initialize app the user that is stored in the firebase um

2509
10:04:42,000 --> 10:04:45,200
firebase code or in the instance of firebits

2510
10:04:45,200 --> 10:04:49,120
running inside your application may actually be null and we've talked about

2511
10:04:49,120 --> 10:04:53,436
null in uh previous chapters where we talked about dart and it's basics so you

2512
10:04:53,436 --> 10:04:56,240
can go back to those chapters and watch those so i'm not going to explain what

2513
10:04:56,240 --> 10:04:59,916
null is again but just quickly null is simply said the

2514
10:04:59,916 --> 10:05:03,680
absence of a value in this case absence of the user so

2515
10:05:03,680 --> 10:05:07,916
what we need to do in our application is to ensure

2516
10:05:07,916 --> 10:05:09,840
that a

2517
10:05:09,840 --> 10:05:13,436
the user the current user in the application is

2518
10:05:13,436 --> 10:05:19,040
um non-null meaning that it should be present and also that the user's email

2519
10:05:19,040 --> 10:05:22,160
should be verified okay so

2520
10:05:22,160 --> 10:05:27,040
you may be asking why is it important for a user's email to be

2521
10:05:27,040 --> 10:05:29,436
verified the reason

2522
10:05:29,436 --> 10:05:32,960
i mean also before i say why is it important for a user's email to be

2523
10:05:32,960 --> 10:05:37,916
verified maybe let's talk first about what an email verification is and

2524
10:05:37,916 --> 10:05:42,080
that whether you've already seen it or not so in a lot of services online if

2525
10:05:42,080 --> 10:05:46,160
for instance you go to a website even if it's a shopping website or

2526
10:05:46,160 --> 10:05:49,520
amazon or whatever ebay if you say okay i want to register a new user and you

2527
10:05:49,520 --> 10:05:54,000
say okay here's my email address here's a password of my choosing um

2528
10:05:54,000 --> 10:05:57,276
once you do that you will be logged into the website

2529
10:05:57,276 --> 10:06:00,400
they'll say okay if this email doesn't exist already

2530
10:06:00,400 --> 10:06:04,480
i'm gonna allow you to register this but then you wouldn't really be able to do

2531
10:06:04,480 --> 10:06:07,680
so much with the website you can search stuff but you probably won't be able to

2532
10:06:07,680 --> 10:06:11,756
buy things unless until unless you've

2533
10:06:11,756 --> 10:06:15,436
verified your email and that means that as soon as you register for amazon for

2534
10:06:15,436 --> 10:06:19,276
instance then it will send you an email to the email that that you chose upon

2535
10:06:19,276 --> 10:06:23,916
registration and there will usually be a link in that email and say thank you for

2536
10:06:23,916 --> 10:06:28,960
registering a user at amazon or ebay click on this link to verify your email

2537
10:06:28,960 --> 10:06:32,880
address you've probably seen emails like that so

2538
10:06:32,880 --> 10:06:35,916
you could just go to your inbox and search for verify and you'll probably

2539
10:06:35,916 --> 10:06:42,640
find lots of emails that ask you verify your account with the service so um

2540
10:06:42,640 --> 10:06:45,756
now let's now that we talked about what email verification is let's talk about

2541
10:06:45,756 --> 10:06:50,400
why it's important well let's say that i'm a user and i want to use this

2542
10:06:50,400 --> 10:06:53,680
application that we're developing so i want to score some notes in it

2543
10:06:53,680 --> 10:06:59,680
then i'll go and and register myself under an email that i don't own

2544
10:06:59,680 --> 10:07:03,680
all right so let's say then i register my

2545
10:07:03,680 --> 10:07:08,080
your email address with a password of my choosing since you haven't registered

2546
10:07:08,080 --> 10:07:12,080
your email address yet with the service icon and ahead of you and register your

2547
10:07:12,080 --> 10:07:16,080
email address with the service and now i'll just log in

2548
10:07:16,080 --> 10:07:19,680
remember i'm not logging into your email i'm logging into this application with

2549
10:07:19,680 --> 10:07:24,320
your email now now i've taken that email so if you then

2550
10:07:24,320 --> 10:07:28,240
who's the rightful owner of your email address comes to this application and

2551
10:07:28,240 --> 10:07:32,800
say oh i'm a foobarbaz gmail.com and i want to register an account with this

2552
10:07:32,800 --> 10:07:36,400
application and it says oops that email address was already taken so you'd be

2553
10:07:36,400 --> 10:07:39,520
like how is that taken that's my email address so

2554
10:07:39,520 --> 10:07:43,596
that is the importance of email verification what we need to do in our

2555
10:07:43,596 --> 10:07:47,520
application is to make sure that whenever someone comes and registers a

2556
10:07:47,520 --> 10:07:51,596
user using the email address and a password of their choosing then we're

2557
10:07:51,596 --> 10:07:56,960
gonna send a real email using firebase to that email address and say

2558
10:07:56,960 --> 10:08:03,040
hey you just registered a user here make sure that you click on this link that

2559
10:08:03,040 --> 10:08:08,880
says verify blah blah to actually verify your user with our application or with

2560
10:08:08,880 --> 10:08:13,756
our file with our applications firebase instance that sits on firebase cloud all

2561
10:08:13,756 --> 10:08:18,080
right so so what we need to do now is to go in

2562
10:08:18,080 --> 10:08:20,560
here in the connection state done you see

2563
10:08:20,560 --> 10:08:26,480
let's then check the current user okay let's see if this current user actually

2564
10:08:26,480 --> 10:08:31,040
is logged into the application so let's say firebase

2565
10:08:31,040 --> 10:08:34,720
um and then let's say

2566
10:08:34,720 --> 10:08:38,800
firebase app i believe it's called instance

2567
10:08:38,800 --> 10:08:42,800
let's see got instance

2568
10:08:42,800 --> 10:08:47,756
changelog firebase all right let's see if we can actually

2569
10:08:47,756 --> 10:08:51,200
google that together okay so this is good for you to also see

2570
10:08:51,200 --> 10:08:56,240
right base flutter get current user we're probably going to end up on some

2571
10:08:56,240 --> 10:09:00,480
sort of a stack overflow and we'll have a look at how we can

2572
10:09:00,480 --> 10:09:04,880
actually retrieve the current user as you can see the response here is from a

2573
10:09:04,880 --> 10:09:08,960
user whose username is quite

2574
10:09:08,960 --> 10:09:15,040
dissu kurt jr i apologize if i'm butching this name but you can see that

2575
10:09:15,040 --> 10:09:18,480
it's provided here for you that it says firebaseos.instance

2576
10:09:18,480 --> 10:09:22,480
and using that instance then you can get the current user so let's do the same

2577
10:09:22,480 --> 10:09:27,436
thing here let's say firebase off dot instance

2578
10:09:27,436 --> 10:09:30,480
and then current user okay

2579
10:09:30,480 --> 10:09:34,720
i'm gonna get rid of this screen on the left which which is our project browser

2580
10:09:34,720 --> 10:09:39,756
and i'm gonna print this statement right here before we return the done text okay

2581
10:09:39,756 --> 10:09:44,560
so i'll bring up the debug console clear the debug console and i'm going to say

2582
10:09:44,560 --> 10:09:49,040
command s all right and since we've made a lot of changes

2583
10:09:49,040 --> 10:09:52,720
here you see we created a home page lots of stuff in here so what we need to do

2584
10:09:52,720 --> 10:09:56,480
is just do a hot restart basically flutter in this case wasn't able to

2585
10:09:56,480 --> 10:10:01,276
really understand what we've changed in our home page so

2586
10:10:01,276 --> 10:10:05,916
there were so many changes that it just couldn't handle so a hot restart is the

2587
10:10:05,916 --> 10:10:09,756
remedy there now you can see here as we printed the

2588
10:10:09,756 --> 10:10:13,200
current user i'm going to do this so you can see more

2589
10:10:13,200 --> 10:10:16,800
of the the output i'm going to bring it up a

2590
10:10:16,800 --> 10:10:19,916
little bit i'm going to increase the size quite dramatically so you can see

2591
10:10:19,916 --> 10:10:22,880
it better as well and

2592
10:10:22,880 --> 10:10:26,640
i'm going to highlight the parts that were actually printed so this is what

2593
10:10:26,640 --> 10:10:30,640
firebase or this is what the print statement printed out for us and this is

2594
10:10:30,640 --> 10:10:35,040
user credentials that were created by firebase and

2595
10:10:35,040 --> 10:10:38,240
if you remember from the previous chapter i said that make sure before you

2596
10:10:38,240 --> 10:10:43,436
come to this chapter that you have a login user and this is the reason i

2597
10:10:43,436 --> 10:10:47,596
wanted us to i wanted the firebase instance in our application to already

2598
10:10:47,596 --> 10:10:51,680
know that you're logged in so that when we print your current user credentials

2599
10:10:51,680 --> 10:10:55,200
then as you can see it says here's the email address

2600
10:10:55,200 --> 10:10:59,840
and then there's a property called email verified false and it says are you an

2601
10:10:59,840 --> 10:11:03,436
anonymous user false and if you remember from one of

2602
10:11:03,436 --> 10:11:07,276
the earlier chapters when i talked about the firebase setup then

2603
10:11:07,276 --> 10:11:11,436
an anonymous user is a user who hasn't really logged into the application yet

2604
10:11:11,436 --> 10:11:13,840
and firebase is intelligent enough to

2605
10:11:13,840 --> 10:11:17,756
understand that any user who comes to your application who hasn't logged in

2606
10:11:17,756 --> 10:11:21,680
before or and their login information isn't saved in keychain or

2607
10:11:21,680 --> 10:11:26,400
shared preferences on android then that user is anonymous anonymous by default

2608
10:11:26,400 --> 10:11:31,276
so if you didn't take the um last action from the previous chapter

2609
10:11:31,276 --> 10:11:35,040
and you didn't log into the application with your current user

2610
10:11:35,040 --> 10:11:38,560
then you will actually be anonymous here so this flag will say true

2611
10:11:38,560 --> 10:11:41,916
but since we've already done that we've logged into the application then you'll

2612
10:11:41,916 --> 10:11:45,916
see our credentials being printed to the screen

2613
10:11:45,916 --> 10:11:49,916
now this is the part that i was interested in which is email verified

2614
10:11:49,916 --> 10:11:56,000
and it says false so what we're going to do here is to say

2615
10:11:56,000 --> 10:12:01,040
take the user so we're saying a final user is firebase off instance current

2616
10:12:01,040 --> 10:12:04,400
user i'm going to decrease the size a little bit here okay

2617
10:12:04,400 --> 10:12:08,960
and i'm gonna make the screen a little bit bigger so you can see it better

2618
10:12:08,960 --> 10:12:12,640
and let's go then create an if statement here

2619
10:12:12,640 --> 10:12:17,200
and let's say that we're gonna say what what have i planned for it let's just

2620
10:12:17,200 --> 10:12:23,276
say if user is verified email verified then we're going

2621
10:12:23,276 --> 10:12:27,916
to say print you are a verified user

2622
10:12:27,916 --> 10:12:33,596
and otherwise we're going to say print you need

2623
10:12:33,596 --> 10:12:37,360
verify your email first

2624
10:12:37,360 --> 10:12:40,800
so you see here because i'm so glad that

2625
10:12:40,800 --> 10:12:44,640
actually we're seeing this error you can see the entire error

2626
10:12:44,640 --> 10:12:47,276
it says how can i scroll here it says the

2627
10:12:47,276 --> 10:12:50,960
property email verify can't be unconditionally accessed because the

2628
10:12:50,960 --> 10:12:56,640
receiver can be null try making the access condition using question mark dot

2629
10:12:56,640 --> 10:13:01,916
or adding a null check to the target so what this is saying is if you go to this

2630
10:13:01,916 --> 10:13:06,880
user move your mouse over it uh if i can do that oh no

2631
10:13:06,880 --> 10:13:12,080
here you'll see that it says user is an optional user so what firebase has done

2632
10:13:12,080 --> 10:13:15,360
here is saying this current user property that you can

2633
10:13:15,360 --> 10:13:19,840
see here is an optional user meaning that well if something goes wrong and

2634
10:13:19,840 --> 10:13:23,436
firebase can't actually calculate your current user

2635
10:13:23,436 --> 10:13:27,360
for instance if you disable anonymous users which you can actually do

2636
10:13:27,360 --> 10:13:31,120
then firebase will be said it will be saying oops

2637
10:13:31,120 --> 10:13:34,240
null user the user is absent i don't know who this

2638
10:13:34,240 --> 10:13:38,480
user is so that is firebase api telling your

2639
10:13:38,480 --> 10:13:42,080
application that if you're using my api then you need to handle this case you

2640
10:13:42,080 --> 10:13:45,916
can't just ask me if the email is verified because the user may actually

2641
10:13:45,916 --> 10:13:50,720
be null the user may be absent so there was a great suggestion here you

2642
10:13:50,720 --> 10:13:54,800
saw here that says you can conditionally access that property using the question

2643
10:13:54,800 --> 10:13:58,800
mark dot syntax so let's do that question mark

2644
10:13:58,800 --> 10:14:03,200
done but as you do that you see you'll get another problem

2645
10:14:03,200 --> 10:14:08,320
it says okay you're asking me to compare an optional

2646
10:14:08,320 --> 10:14:10,720
boolean with

2647
10:14:10,720 --> 10:14:14,880
an actual boolean because remember your if conditions need to resolve in into a

2648
10:14:14,880 --> 10:14:20,480
true or false so um so in this case what you can do is

2649
10:14:20,480 --> 10:14:24,000
to either create something called for instance if an intermediate variable you

2650
10:14:24,000 --> 10:14:29,120
can say final email verified

2651
10:14:29,120 --> 10:14:33,840
and you'll say that is equal to user optional access to email verified field

2652
10:14:33,840 --> 10:14:38,160
or false you see this is the question mark question mark which we've already

2653
10:14:38,160 --> 10:14:41,436
talked about when we talked about dark basics so

2654
10:14:41,436 --> 10:14:46,240
what you said here is take the left hand side of this operator of question mark

2655
10:14:46,240 --> 10:14:51,120
question mark which is a null aware operator you say if the left hand side

2656
10:14:51,120 --> 10:14:56,080
exists take it otherwise take the value on the right okay so now if you move

2657
10:14:56,080 --> 10:15:00,800
your mouse over email verify you'll see that it's a boolean all right

2658
10:15:00,800 --> 10:15:05,120
perfect so you could either do that or get rid of this intermediate variable

2659
10:15:05,120 --> 10:15:08,720
that you created here and literally just put the exact same code in your if

2660
10:15:08,720 --> 10:15:12,800
statement and that will work exactly as it did up there so let's just go ahead

2661
10:15:12,800 --> 10:15:16,240
with that one less line of code one

2662
10:15:16,240 --> 10:15:21,840
line of code less maybe um all right so

2663
10:15:21,840 --> 10:15:25,520
if the user's email verified or false is true

2664
10:15:25,520 --> 10:15:30,240
which means that if the user's email verification could be read as true or

2665
10:15:30,240 --> 10:15:37,200
false and if you can't use false if the equation then in itself is true then the

2666
10:15:37,200 --> 10:15:41,520
user is verified otherwise the user isn't verified so

2667
10:15:41,520 --> 10:15:46,000
let's do command s there let's bring up our console i'm going to

2668
10:15:46,000 --> 10:15:49,840
change the screen layout a little bit so you can see better

2669
10:15:49,840 --> 10:15:53,276
and you can see here it says you need to verify your email i actually clean the

2670
10:15:53,276 --> 10:15:56,400
screen a little bit and command s again so you'll see a little bit less

2671
10:15:56,400 --> 10:16:00,480
information on screen and you can see our print statement which was here got

2672
10:16:00,480 --> 10:16:05,040
printed saying that yeah you haven't verified your email and you need to do

2673
10:16:05,040 --> 10:16:09,200
that first okay a lot of information but maybe less

2674
10:16:09,200 --> 10:16:13,040
than the other chapters and to be honest with you this is all we have to talk

2675
10:16:13,040 --> 10:16:15,916
about in this chapter i just wanted to display

2676
10:16:15,916 --> 10:16:20,960
or and show you that um or actually explain first what email verification is

2677
10:16:20,960 --> 10:16:25,520
why is it important and that we're we are going to use email verification in

2678
10:16:25,520 --> 10:16:28,480
our in our application as you'll soon see

2679
10:16:28,480 --> 10:16:34,400
and how can you actually read that property from a firebase user

2680
10:16:34,400 --> 10:16:38,560
great that was all for this chapter now the

2681
10:16:38,560 --> 10:16:42,240
next chapter is going to be a little bit different you may actually expect a

2682
10:16:42,240 --> 10:16:46,480
continuation of this chapter you would think that we're going to jump right

2683
10:16:46,480 --> 10:16:51,120
into email verification but i have intentionally actually put a little bit

2684
10:16:51,120 --> 10:16:54,640
of a pause in our flow because this is something you'll

2685
10:16:54,640 --> 10:16:58,160
have to do as a software developer sometimes in that if you see something

2686
10:16:58,160 --> 10:17:02,400
not kind of correct something isn't working

2687
10:17:02,400 --> 10:17:05,680
right then you'll need to address it as soon as possible and this is something

2688
10:17:05,680 --> 10:17:10,080
we're going to address in the next chapter the problem here that you may

2689
10:17:10,080 --> 10:17:13,596
may if you're a seasoned software developer or may not have thought about

2690
10:17:13,596 --> 10:17:17,916
is that we are just writing code on our computer

2691
10:17:17,916 --> 10:17:23,680
this code could be easily deleted by a malicious program a virus or if

2692
10:17:23,680 --> 10:17:28,480
something happens to our computer all this could just go away and you'll lose

2693
10:17:28,480 --> 10:17:31,276
everything that you've written so if you're not coming from a software

2694
10:17:31,276 --> 10:17:35,596
engineering background then you may not know what git and github are

2695
10:17:35,596 --> 10:17:37,916
now i'm not going to scare you to be honest

2696
10:17:37,916 --> 10:17:41,596
with you this is not something scary but um

2697
10:17:41,596 --> 10:17:44,720
what we need to do is just to make sure that we have a backup of our code and

2698
10:17:44,720 --> 10:17:48,240
just that's just common sense like even if you're a designer even if you're a

2699
10:17:48,240 --> 10:17:53,200
music producer even if you're a soft if if your product owner whoever

2700
10:17:53,200 --> 10:17:58,000
or product manager you probably know that whatever you're working on needs to

2701
10:17:58,000 --> 10:18:02,240
be saved somewhere safely so if you have a video file you're not just going to

2702
10:18:02,240 --> 10:18:05,200
put it on your computer you're probably going to make a backup of it if you're

2703
10:18:05,200 --> 10:18:09,596
working with figma that that file is already shared in the cloud is sorry not

2704
10:18:09,596 --> 10:18:12,800
shared it's already stored in the cloud so

2705
10:18:12,800 --> 10:18:18,960
it's very rarely that you will work on pieces of um documents that are not

2706
10:18:18,960 --> 10:18:23,120
securely stored in some sort of cloud and even if you're working for instance

2707
10:18:23,120 --> 10:18:28,240
with a document then nowadays there's also shared like um sorry there are

2708
10:18:28,240 --> 10:18:30,800
cloud solutions for storing your documents

2709
10:18:30,800 --> 10:18:34,480
securely in the cloud so um i mean it pretty much

2710
10:18:34,480 --> 10:18:38,480
almost always when you're working on a user generated document or a source code

2711
10:18:38,480 --> 10:18:41,680
in this case you'll need to make sure that it's securely stored in the cloud

2712
10:18:41,680 --> 10:18:44,720
and that's what we're going to do in the next chapter so we're going to talk

2713
10:18:44,720 --> 10:18:48,880
about git and github we're going to set up our gpg keys

2714
10:18:48,880 --> 10:18:53,120
or pgp keys how do you want to say it and we're actually going to dive a

2715
10:18:53,120 --> 10:18:57,276
little bit deep into git and what it actually means and why it is why is it

2716
10:18:57,276 --> 10:19:03,040
good why do software developers talk a lot about git and as you might know

2717
10:19:03,040 --> 10:19:06,720
this course well not might you already know this course

2718
10:19:06,720 --> 10:19:12,320
is about flutter but i couldn't help put this chapter in

2719
10:19:12,320 --> 10:19:15,756
because i believe if you're not a software developer if you're coming from

2720
10:19:15,756 --> 10:19:20,720
another background then it is my duty kind of to tell you

2721
10:19:20,720 --> 10:19:25,520
about git and github and why is it important how to use it how i like to do

2722
10:19:25,520 --> 10:19:29,040
very simple tasks with getting github so um

2723
10:19:29,040 --> 10:19:32,320
so let's then prepare ourselves for the next chapter which is going to be a

2724
10:19:32,320 --> 10:19:36,880
little bit less coding it's not really we're not at all almost not at all going

2725
10:19:36,880 --> 10:19:41,120
to be working on the source code we're mainly going to work with git and github

2726
10:19:41,120 --> 10:19:44,800
so with that said i will wrap up this

2727
10:19:44,800 --> 10:19:50,400
chapter and i'll see you in the next one hello and welcome to chapter 15 of this

2728
10:19:50,400 --> 10:19:54,000
letter course in previous chapters we talked a lot

2729
10:19:54,000 --> 10:19:58,320
about setting up our project so we've so far been working a lot with setting up

2730
10:19:58,320 --> 10:20:02,880
the project and the basics we also created our login and registered views

2731
10:20:02,880 --> 10:20:07,040
in our flutter application as i was developing this course myself i got to

2732
10:20:07,040 --> 10:20:11,120
the point that there was a lot of code being written by me and then i needed to

2733
10:20:11,120 --> 10:20:15,120
make sure that it is stored in a in a place where i can always go

2734
10:20:15,120 --> 10:20:19,040
back to even if i lose this information on my computer that i can go back to

2735
10:20:19,040 --> 10:20:23,756
that place and then retrieve that code so um

2736
10:20:23,756 --> 10:20:26,400
if you're a software developer if you're if you're a seasoned software developer

2737
10:20:26,400 --> 10:20:30,000
from before and you know what git and github are and you're comfortable using

2738
10:20:30,000 --> 10:20:34,000
them and you know how to set up for instance your secure keys with gpg

2739
10:20:34,000 --> 10:20:37,680
then you can safely jump over this chapter but if you're a designer product

2740
10:20:37,680 --> 10:20:42,160
owner product manager whoever who doesn't know what git and github are or

2741
10:20:42,160 --> 10:20:45,596
maybe need some help setting those things up

2742
10:20:45,596 --> 10:20:50,480
then this is a good chapter for you uh otherwise you can just skim quickly

2743
10:20:50,480 --> 10:20:52,480
over so

2744
10:20:52,480 --> 10:20:56,000
let's let's talk quickly about what git and

2745
10:20:56,000 --> 10:21:00,640
github are and why we need them um as i mentioned when you're working with your

2746
10:21:00,640 --> 10:21:03,436
code for instance as i was while developing this course then you're

2747
10:21:03,436 --> 10:21:08,560
writing a lot of code which is i mean intrinsically valuable because

2748
10:21:08,560 --> 10:21:13,276
your time was translated into those pieces of code as you were writing the

2749
10:21:13,276 --> 10:21:18,720
code you spent some time and energy and effort and wrote the code so it is quite

2750
10:21:18,720 --> 10:21:22,720
an important piece of information for you just to lose and depending on the

2751
10:21:22,720 --> 10:21:25,680
type of project you're working on for instance this project it has taken me

2752
10:21:25,680 --> 10:21:31,040
quite a lot of time to even develop the idea of the project and put it together

2753
10:21:31,040 --> 10:21:33,916
so while i was while i was putting together the idea of the course and

2754
10:21:33,916 --> 10:21:38,400
written writing all the bits and pieces that i have to explain in every video i

2755
10:21:38,400 --> 10:21:43,596
made quite a lot of backups of that of those ideas because had i not done that

2756
10:21:43,596 --> 10:21:47,520
and had i just put everything in just one piece of paper or something or just

2757
10:21:47,520 --> 10:21:53,520
even one digital document on my computer had i lost a document then well yeah

2758
10:21:53,520 --> 10:21:58,080
i would have lost it and i would have had to begin from the absolute beginning

2759
10:21:58,080 --> 10:22:01,840
and this is the same thing for your code [Music]

2760
10:22:01,840 --> 10:22:07,200
so you need to use two services called git and github in order to

2761
10:22:07,200 --> 10:22:10,080
store your code

2762
10:22:10,080 --> 10:22:14,560
in in a safe place so that you can always retrieve it later

2763
10:22:14,560 --> 10:22:22,480
so let's talk quickly about what is git and why do you need this um

2764
10:22:22,480 --> 10:22:28,080
so what you need to know about gitz is that git is a

2765
10:22:28,080 --> 10:22:35,276
piece of software on your computer that allows you to

2766
10:22:35,276 --> 10:22:40,320
manage various changes that you make to a code

2767
10:22:40,320 --> 10:22:45,840
base such as our project at different times keeping track of the date those

2768
10:22:45,840 --> 10:22:50,720
changes were made the person who made the changes and the changes themselves

2769
10:22:50,720 --> 10:22:54,720
and also it will be able to provide you the difference between your recent

2770
10:22:54,720 --> 10:22:59,840
changes and what was already provided in the or what was already

2771
10:22:59,840 --> 10:23:06,400
committed into this git repository well what a git repository really is is

2772
10:23:06,400 --> 10:23:09,756
a bucket is an empty bucket initially where there

2773
10:23:09,756 --> 10:23:15,200
is nothing in there and as you interact with your source code then you'd be like

2774
10:23:15,200 --> 10:23:19,200
okay now i want to turn this source code that i've written into a bucket so then

2775
10:23:19,200 --> 10:23:23,520
there's a bucket created around your source code called a git repository

2776
10:23:23,520 --> 10:23:28,960
which keeps track of all the changes that you're that you're making or

2777
10:23:28,960 --> 10:23:33,916
anybody else that works on the same source code is making to the code and it

2778
10:23:33,916 --> 10:23:39,276
will allow you to save snapshots of those changes at

2779
10:23:39,276 --> 10:23:44,160
at specific times of your choosing if you're a designer of your and you're

2780
10:23:44,160 --> 10:23:48,000
working with figma for instance figma already

2781
10:23:48,000 --> 10:23:52,640
automatically saves your work at the times that it sees fit so you never have

2782
10:23:52,640 --> 10:23:57,120
to press really a save button and also figma if you've seen it

2783
10:23:57,120 --> 10:24:03,360
and it keeps track it has a version history so you can literally go to figma

2784
10:24:03,360 --> 10:24:07,520
and say okay i've done my work i want to actually commit my changes in the

2785
10:24:07,520 --> 10:24:10,160
version history and i want to give it a name

2786
10:24:10,160 --> 10:24:14,080
most designers don't do that and they legislate must save their work

2787
10:24:14,080 --> 10:24:18,640
automatically and by that figma just says here's the timeline of your changes

2788
10:24:18,640 --> 10:24:22,160
at this time you did this at this time you did this so

2789
10:24:22,160 --> 10:24:26,480
even if you're a designer you're implicitly using something called a

2790
10:24:26,480 --> 10:24:30,720
version control and which in it in that case is figma

2791
10:24:30,720 --> 10:24:34,000
but when you're coming to the software development world we're working with

2792
10:24:34,000 --> 10:24:38,080
your flutter application there is no figma there and you're working with raw

2793
10:24:38,080 --> 10:24:42,880
code so you're going into visual studio code or sublime or whatever text editor

2794
10:24:42,880 --> 10:24:47,200
that you're using android studio as an id or whatever

2795
10:24:47,200 --> 10:24:51,276
then there is no service sitting there and saying oh you made some changes let

2796
10:24:51,276 --> 10:24:54,560
me let me help you save it in some sort of app

2797
10:24:54,560 --> 10:24:59,200
or a cloud solution so the system that allows you to do that on

2798
10:24:59,200 --> 10:25:03,520
your computer is called git so git is a software that allows you to keep track

2799
10:25:03,520 --> 10:25:07,756
of changes that you're making to source code okay

2800
10:25:07,756 --> 10:25:11,360
so i can see here that before we continue we're gonna actually talk a

2801
10:25:11,360 --> 10:25:15,040
little bit about git and so

2802
10:25:15,040 --> 10:25:19,680
what i'm gonna do here i'm gonna add lib a little bit here and improvise

2803
10:25:19,680 --> 10:25:22,800
and i'm gonna go here and make the screen a little bit bigger i'm gonna

2804
10:25:22,800 --> 10:25:27,276
bring up terminal and you don't see it on that screen because it opened on

2805
10:25:27,276 --> 10:25:31,436
another screen so let me just increase the size and bring

2806
10:25:31,436 --> 10:25:35,916
it up here so you also see it so i'm gonna go here to my development

2807
10:25:35,916 --> 10:25:43,200
folder and i'm going to go to my projects and

2808
10:25:43,200 --> 10:25:47,200
let's think go to

2809
10:25:47,200 --> 10:25:52,400
make a folder i'm going to say git okay

2810
10:25:52,400 --> 10:25:56,480
should i call it git or just let's actually create a folder called

2811
10:25:56,480 --> 10:26:02,240
testing okay let's go into testing then it is an

2812
10:26:02,240 --> 10:26:07,276
empty folder as you can see for now and what we're going to do is we're

2813
10:26:07,276 --> 10:26:12,480
going to tell git now which is a software installed on my computer um to

2814
10:26:12,480 --> 10:26:16,560
tell it that okay all of a sudden i want to turn this empty directory here into

2815
10:26:16,560 --> 10:26:20,640
something called a repository remember it's going to be a bucket then that

2816
10:26:20,640 --> 10:26:25,360
keeps track of changes in the current directory now before we continue maybe

2817
10:26:25,360 --> 10:26:29,276
oh sorry about that maybe you also need to actually install

2818
10:26:29,276 --> 10:26:32,640
git on your computer if you're not coming from a software development

2819
10:26:32,640 --> 10:26:36,640
background you probably don't even have git installed on your computer so i'm

2820
10:26:36,640 --> 10:26:40,960
going to bring up a a browser window here and say install

2821
10:26:40,960 --> 10:26:43,840
git so

2822
10:26:43,840 --> 10:26:49,276
if i google install git you will see that there there's like information

2823
10:26:49,276 --> 10:26:53,680
how you can install git on your computer if you

2824
10:26:53,680 --> 10:27:01,120
are on a macintosh and you have already installed xcode xcode comes pre pre like

2825
10:27:01,120 --> 10:27:05,916
pre-packaged with gits already if you're on windows i believe that you

2826
10:27:05,916 --> 10:27:09,436
actually have to i have a windows machine right here next to me which i

2827
10:27:09,436 --> 10:27:14,320
use daily i believe for windows you'll have to install git personally like

2828
10:27:14,320 --> 10:27:19,120
manual so let's say install git windows

2829
10:27:19,120 --> 10:27:24,800
uh get download package get a time get guys install git

2830
10:27:24,800 --> 10:27:29,120
oops my ipad for some reason got disconnected here so i'm going to have

2831
10:27:29,120 --> 10:27:32,240
some difficulty then um

2832
10:27:32,240 --> 10:27:38,480
let's see now install git on linux okay

2833
10:27:38,480 --> 10:27:42,000
i believe there is a good package actually for getting it on windows let

2834
10:27:42,000 --> 10:27:45,680
me go back here installer on windows you can see here

2835
10:27:45,680 --> 10:27:49,360
just go to i'm going to increase the screen size a little bit as well so you

2836
10:27:49,360 --> 10:27:54,320
can see it a little bit better here it says go to https get scm com

2837
10:27:54,320 --> 10:27:58,240
download win so i'm going to go here and it's going to start downloading so

2838
10:27:58,240 --> 10:28:01,520
i'm just going to say cancel because right now i'm in a macintosh so here is

2839
10:28:01,520 --> 10:28:04,880
where you can download git and install it on your computer

2840
10:28:04,880 --> 10:28:08,160
if you are on a windows machine and you have the linux subsystem which i do on

2841
10:28:08,160 --> 10:28:12,960
my windows machine then you may actually want to download git using see sudo apt

2842
10:28:12,960 --> 10:28:15,276
um on that

2843
10:28:15,276 --> 10:28:18,720
linux subsystem but it is possible that the linux subsystem

2844
10:28:18,720 --> 10:28:22,080
on windows already comes shipped with git so you don't have to do anything i

2845
10:28:22,080 --> 10:28:25,120
wouldn't be surprised if git was one of the absolute core components that was

2846
10:28:25,120 --> 10:28:28,320
shipped with linux um

2847
10:28:28,320 --> 10:28:32,320
so that's for a macintosh and also if you're on a macintosh and you don't have

2848
10:28:32,320 --> 10:28:36,320
xcode for whatever reason um

2849
10:28:36,320 --> 10:28:41,120
then you may need to also download git separately so let's go back here and see

2850
10:28:41,120 --> 10:28:45,840
how you can do that uh if you say mac os here it says there

2851
10:28:45,840 --> 10:28:49,436
are several ways to install get on mac users probably install the xcode command

2852
10:28:49,436 --> 10:28:54,240
line tools which we've already done so if you don't have it in slavery it will

2853
10:28:54,240 --> 10:28:58,640
prompt you to install it so otherwise you can go in here get

2854
10:28:58,640 --> 10:29:03,360
semcom download mac and then you can do brew install git

2855
10:29:03,360 --> 10:29:07,040
so if that is what you want to do then you first have to actually install

2856
10:29:07,040 --> 10:29:09,120
homebrew so

2857
10:29:09,120 --> 10:29:13,596
go into this link and say homebrew install basically just do as it says

2858
10:29:13,596 --> 10:29:18,880
here you see there's the command and then go and install

2859
10:29:18,880 --> 10:29:24,720
git using homebrew and if you're on linux then a sudo apt

2860
10:29:24,720 --> 10:29:28,000
install git i think maybe you don't even need to have sudo if you're installing

2861
10:29:28,000 --> 10:29:33,436
for the current user so just apt app is it get or install i forgot but

2862
10:29:33,436 --> 10:29:38,080
there's information about linux here as well

2863
10:29:38,080 --> 10:29:42,160
app install yeah get all so

2864
10:29:42,160 --> 10:29:45,840
yeah i mean i'm assuming you're kind of like on a debian based distribution as

2865
10:29:45,840 --> 10:29:50,880
well but otherwise there's information here how you can install it otherwise so

2866
10:29:50,880 --> 10:29:54,000
all right uh that was a lot of information and before

2867
10:29:54,000 --> 10:29:57,596
we continue i'm just going to try to make sure that i'm connected back to my

2868
10:29:57,596 --> 10:30:02,480
uh to my laptop to my ipad here because on

2869
10:30:02,480 --> 10:30:06,560
my ipad i keep hold of all the information that i have to provide to

2870
10:30:06,560 --> 10:30:10,400
you in some sort of like a chronological order so it is very important for me to

2871
10:30:10,400 --> 10:30:14,720
actually get my notes up there so i'm going to try to connect to my ipad and

2872
10:30:14,720 --> 10:30:18,400
yeah there it is okay

2873
10:30:18,400 --> 10:30:21,360
so now that you've i'm assuming that you've

2874
10:30:21,360 --> 10:30:26,160
installed git i'm assuming that that is done if you say which git

2875
10:30:26,160 --> 10:30:30,320
then it's going to tell me in this case that user being get that's where get it

2876
10:30:30,320 --> 10:30:34,400
installed if you're on windows to be honest with you i don't know the command

2877
10:30:34,400 --> 10:30:39,360
on windows to know whether it come like git is installed but on windows all you

2878
10:30:39,360 --> 10:30:43,120
have to do is just to type git and if if you see that

2879
10:30:43,120 --> 10:30:47,916
it throws an error it says git isn't available either you haven't installed

2880
10:30:47,916 --> 10:30:53,520
git and if you have installed git maybe git isn't in the current path so you'll

2881
10:30:53,520 --> 10:30:57,436
have to go and adjust your environment variables in order to get git and

2882
10:30:57,436 --> 10:31:01,680
is lots of information on the internet so we're not going to focus right now on

2883
10:31:01,680 --> 10:31:05,200
how to install git exactly because that's going to be like its own course

2884
10:31:05,200 --> 10:31:07,520
maybe but if you follow the instructions that

2885
10:31:07,520 --> 10:31:11,200
were provided on the website that i just showed you should be able to get far

2886
10:31:11,200 --> 10:31:15,120
so i'm assuming now git is is installed on

2887
10:31:15,120 --> 10:31:19,040
our computer and you can see here we're in a folder called testing so if i say

2888
10:31:19,040 --> 10:31:23,360
where that testing is you can see that is is right here now what we want to do

2889
10:31:23,360 --> 10:31:26,800
is to say testing for instance is the project that we're gonna place all our

2890
10:31:26,800 --> 10:31:30,480
code in okay so there's gonna be information that we're gonna write here

2891
10:31:30,480 --> 10:31:35,840
in this um in this folder there's gonna be some dart files there's gonna be some

2892
10:31:35,840 --> 10:31:40,640
png and jpeg files there's gonna be our application icon all that stuff

2893
10:31:40,640 --> 10:31:44,240
and we want to store this safely so

2894
10:31:44,240 --> 10:31:51,040
the first thing you may want to do is to to basically tell git that this current

2895
10:31:51,040 --> 10:31:57,120
directory in itself is a git's repository so the bucket remember the

2896
10:31:57,120 --> 10:32:00,160
bucket is going to wrap itself around the directory so

2897
10:32:00,160 --> 10:32:03,596
if i get the contents of this directory at the moment you can see that it's

2898
10:32:03,596 --> 10:32:08,320
completely empty but if you want to create a git bucket or a git repository

2899
10:32:08,320 --> 10:32:13,120
around this directory all you have to say is just to say git init dots

2900
10:32:13,120 --> 10:32:16,960
okay you'll see here now it says that

2901
10:32:16,960 --> 10:32:20,720
initialize amt git repository in this folder

2902
10:32:20,720 --> 10:32:24,320
so now if i get the contents of this folder you'll see that there is a new

2903
10:32:24,320 --> 10:32:29,120
directory called dot git and dot git directory is where git basically keeps

2904
10:32:29,120 --> 10:32:33,840
track of its internal like the changes to this directory and like

2905
10:32:33,840 --> 10:32:37,680
what you save when you save it who is it that

2906
10:32:37,680 --> 10:32:42,240
saved the work etc so now that you've done that now you've created a git

2907
10:32:42,240 --> 10:32:47,360
repository basically around this empty directory you can issue various diff git

2908
10:32:47,360 --> 10:32:50,400
commands such as its status

2909
10:32:50,400 --> 10:32:54,800
this will give you the current status on this um

2910
10:32:54,800 --> 10:32:58,880
on this uh directory and you can see here as soon

2911
10:32:58,880 --> 10:33:03,840
as we created a git repository with git in it all of a sudden my terminal

2912
10:33:03,840 --> 10:33:08,640
changed my prompt here and said that all of a sudden testing is not just testing

2913
10:33:08,640 --> 10:33:12,800
anymore but it's actually a git directory and we're on a branch called

2914
10:33:12,800 --> 10:33:15,436
main now

2915
10:33:15,436 --> 10:33:18,960
i don't want to talk about branches right now but just know that there are

2916
10:33:18,960 --> 10:33:21,840
um yeah let's just not talk about branches

2917
10:33:21,840 --> 10:33:25,360
right now because i'm planning to do that a little bit later so

2918
10:33:25,360 --> 10:33:28,800
so but what we are going to talk about is this little message here that says no

2919
10:33:28,800 --> 10:33:34,880
commits yet now in git whenever you're working um git

2920
10:33:34,880 --> 10:33:38,720
doesn't just save your work automatically you need to tell git to

2921
10:33:38,720 --> 10:33:43,120
save your work and those points where you save your work there are call

2922
10:33:43,120 --> 10:33:47,840
commits it commits as its name indicates is you committing your work you say i

2923
10:33:47,840 --> 10:33:52,640
committed to this and i want to save it and that's i mean it could be called

2924
10:33:52,640 --> 10:33:55,916
save but save is maybe

2925
10:33:55,916 --> 10:33:59,436
um it could be uh like

2926
10:33:59,436 --> 10:34:04,160
read as kind of more like a verb like oh am i gonna save it now or what is it but

2927
10:34:04,160 --> 10:34:08,480
if i say here's my commit then it could be a little bit easier to infer

2928
10:34:08,480 --> 10:34:13,276
that oh it's a piece of information that you've saved and you've committed to so

2929
10:34:13,276 --> 10:34:16,800
i think maybe that's the reason it's called the committee i'm not sure

2930
10:34:16,800 --> 10:34:20,560
so those commits are points of time where a

2931
10:34:20,560 --> 10:34:24,800
person that has access to this repository saved their work okay so just

2932
10:34:24,800 --> 10:34:30,320
remember that that is a commit and if we see here the status says no commits yet

2933
10:34:30,320 --> 10:34:34,000
because there was literally nothing that you told get to save now what we're

2934
10:34:34,000 --> 10:34:37,200
going to do is to open up visual studio code so i'm going to bring up you just

2935
10:34:37,200 --> 10:34:40,720
to studio code here and you can see it's an empty folder

2936
10:34:40,720 --> 10:34:44,160
and i'm gonna create a file here and let's just call

2937
10:34:44,160 --> 10:34:48,200
um let's call this um

2938
10:34:48,200 --> 10:34:54,160
info.txt so just text file okay so here's an empty file and i'm just

2939
10:34:54,160 --> 10:34:57,840
gonna type hello in here increase the size a little bit as well so you can see

2940
10:34:57,840 --> 10:34:59,756
better so

2941
10:34:59,756 --> 10:35:03,756
now if i say git status here you can see all of a sudden it doesn't say no

2942
10:35:03,756 --> 10:35:10,400
commits yet it it well basically it says dad but it also says on track files and

2943
10:35:10,400 --> 10:35:16,560
it puts the info text right here now let me then explain what attract file

2944
10:35:16,560 --> 10:35:21,520
and on track file is a track file is a file that you've told git about before

2945
10:35:21,520 --> 10:35:26,240
so it it's tracking the changes being made to that file

2946
10:35:26,240 --> 10:35:31,360
on track file is a file that you have not told yet before about so it says oh

2947
10:35:31,360 --> 10:35:34,960
here's a file you're doing something with it but i'm not gonna even look at

2948
10:35:34,960 --> 10:35:38,480
it i'm not gonna keep track of it because you don't you didn't tell me to

2949
10:35:38,480 --> 10:35:40,640
do so so

2950
10:35:40,640 --> 10:35:45,276
and things um i mean yeah a file basically can be in

2951
10:35:45,276 --> 10:35:49,916
three states in git right now you've learned two of them either tracked or on

2952
10:35:49,916 --> 10:35:55,680
track but it could also be in another state that i will show you soon

2953
10:35:55,680 --> 10:35:58,640
so now you can see there's a message here

2954
10:35:58,640 --> 10:36:02,880
that it says let me bring actually the terminal a little bit up here so you can

2955
10:36:02,880 --> 10:36:08,000
see the terminal in its entirety it says use git add and then the name of the

2956
10:36:08,000 --> 10:36:12,320
file in order to include what will be committed so let's do that i'm just

2957
10:36:12,320 --> 10:36:17,360
going to say git add info txt and now i'm going to say git status and

2958
10:36:17,360 --> 10:36:21,276
all of a sudden you'll see that get understood that here's a new file you're

2959
10:36:21,276 --> 10:36:26,480
committing committing this file called info text but you can see

2960
10:36:26,480 --> 10:36:30,480
that it still says you haven't committed anything but it says changes to be

2961
10:36:30,480 --> 10:36:34,240
committed and all of a sudden this file is green

2962
10:36:34,240 --> 10:36:38,400
remember i said a file can be in three states on tracked which means git

2963
10:36:38,400 --> 10:36:42,800
doesn't know about it tracked which means it does know about it or it could

2964
10:36:42,800 --> 10:36:47,520
be staged so if you see here this file is green

2965
10:36:47,520 --> 10:36:51,916
and it says changes to be committed so stage is where

2966
10:36:51,916 --> 10:36:56,960
you have made changes to a file and you've told git that you want to

2967
10:36:56,960 --> 10:37:00,160
commit it but you haven't committed it yet

2968
10:37:00,160 --> 10:37:04,720
now you may be asking okay why would i have files that aren't going to be

2969
10:37:04,720 --> 10:37:09,276
committed in some projects if you have some information for instance if you're

2970
10:37:09,276 --> 10:37:13,756
working with 10 other developers and you're making some

2971
10:37:13,756 --> 10:37:17,756
tests and you're writing some code in the in the directory where your source

2972
10:37:17,756 --> 10:37:21,756
code is placed at but you don't you're not really ready with that file yet you

2973
10:37:21,756 --> 10:37:25,040
don't want to commit it into a branch where everyone else sees then you could

2974
10:37:25,040 --> 10:37:29,596
say oh i'm not going to commit this it is not staged file i'm not even ready

2975
10:37:29,596 --> 10:37:33,360
for staging it and putting it into the commit so in that case you're not going

2976
10:37:33,360 --> 10:37:36,800
to add it to the staging area okay so remember that

2977
10:37:36,800 --> 10:37:40,640
now that you've you've done that you just said git add you can commit it and

2978
10:37:40,640 --> 10:37:45,436
a commit literally means that you're going to save this work in git okay

2979
10:37:45,436 --> 10:37:48,480
and the way to do that is using git commits

2980
10:37:48,480 --> 10:37:53,916
and then you will provide a message using dash m here and then quotation

2981
10:37:53,916 --> 10:37:58,000
marks okay so here you will write a message that will be appended to your

2982
10:37:58,000 --> 10:38:02,720
entire commit so what we're going to do here says

2983
10:38:02,720 --> 10:38:08,560
let's just say add new info txt file for fun okay and

2984
10:38:08,560 --> 10:38:12,800
then i'm just going to press enter and see here it says one file change and

2985
10:38:12,800 --> 10:38:17,756
one insertions and it will say that yeah it has created this file okay so i'm

2986
10:38:17,756 --> 10:38:23,040
gonna clear my uh terminal now and we're gonna do git status

2987
10:38:23,040 --> 10:38:27,120
all of a sudden that message that about no commits yet disappeared and all this

2988
10:38:27,120 --> 10:38:30,960
is is that is that you're on a branch called main and there's nothing to

2989
10:38:30,960 --> 10:38:33,756
commit okay so

2990
10:38:33,756 --> 10:38:37,916
what do you do then if you want to see the commit that you just made like if

2991
10:38:37,916 --> 10:38:41,120
you want to see okay what are all the comments that were made then in that

2992
10:38:41,120 --> 10:38:45,120
case you can say git log and git blog will display

2993
10:38:45,120 --> 10:38:49,276
all the all the commits that were made and who they were made by and you will

2994
10:38:49,276 --> 10:38:53,520
also be able to see the date that were made and the commit message do you

2995
10:38:53,520 --> 10:39:00,400
remember we said git commit dash m so that was the message provided in the get

2996
10:39:00,400 --> 10:39:04,480
command and then saved in the repository okay

2997
10:39:04,480 --> 10:39:07,040
so that is the message and that's the email

2998
10:39:07,040 --> 10:39:11,596
of the person who basically did that commit

2999
10:39:11,596 --> 10:39:16,080
now i jumped over a little bit here and um

3000
10:39:16,080 --> 10:39:20,160
and to be honest with you that was i didn't really think about that some
