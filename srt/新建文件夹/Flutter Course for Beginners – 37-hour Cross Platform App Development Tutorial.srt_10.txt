1
08:22:50,080 --> 08:22:53,760
make sure that your app is not made for kids because remember applications that


2
08:22:53,760 --> 08:22:57,512
are made for kids that have to actually conform to specific standards in order


3
08:22:57,512 --> 08:23:01,592
to make sure that eight kids of age four plus are actually safe in the


4
08:23:01,592 --> 08:23:05,360
application so um what we could do let's see in here if


5
08:23:05,360 --> 08:23:09,440
your app rates 12 plus or lower and you believe it contents may not be suitable


6
08:23:09,440 --> 08:23:14,640
for children under 17 you can manually set the age rating to 17 plus so i'm not


7
08:23:14,640 --> 08:23:17,280
sure about this to be honest with you but i'm just going to leave it blank at


8
08:23:17,280 --> 08:23:20,552
the moment and press the down button okay and then we can press the save


9
08:23:20,552 --> 08:23:24,400
button right here so the next thing that we need to talk


10
08:23:24,400 --> 08:23:28,800
about now is something called a support url and support url is actually very


11
08:23:28,800 --> 08:23:33,360
important and that actually appears i believe in app


12
08:23:33,360 --> 08:23:37,760
let's see is it in


13
08:23:38,640 --> 08:23:44,160
app information i believe i think it is somewhere around here


14
08:23:44,160 --> 08:23:50,232
ratings and reviews app privacy pricing and availability


15
08:23:50,232 --> 08:23:54,232
we haven't really come there yet but i believe we have to submit that anyway


16
08:23:54,232 --> 08:23:58,640
somewhere and it is here as you can see so support url is actually very very


17
08:23:58,640 --> 08:24:01,360
important as you can see marketing url is not


18
08:24:01,360 --> 08:24:05,512
optional sorry marketing url is optional support url isn't a support url it's


19
08:24:05,512 --> 08:24:09,192
basically a url that needs to be hosted on your website


20
08:24:09,192 --> 08:24:12,480
that users of your application if they have any problem with it then they can


21
08:24:12,480 --> 08:24:16,320
go to the support url and get some more information about that okay


22
08:24:16,320 --> 08:24:20,960
so i have previously created a support url for one of my other applications in


23
08:24:20,960 --> 08:24:27,120
my website so let's just say pixel sc and then we're going to say support


24
08:24:27,120 --> 08:24:32,320
chords library text okay and as you can see here it's a little text document and


25
08:24:32,320 --> 08:24:34,872
says if you have any questions about this app you can drop us a line at


26
08:24:34,872 --> 08:24:37,680
support pixel dot


27
08:24:37,680 --> 08:24:44,232
so you need to just ensure that you have a support document that you can um


28
08:24:44,232 --> 08:24:50,160
place in a website and then you can send your users to that okay so


29
08:24:50,160 --> 08:24:54,232
let's now go ahead and create a support document so what i'm going to do in here


30
08:24:54,232 --> 08:24:57,832
i'm just going to bring up literally text edit on my macintosh you can bring


31
08:24:57,832 --> 08:25:03,440
your um favorite hex editor um um actually my tech favorite text editor is


32
08:25:03,440 --> 08:25:06,552
visual studio code but in this case it's just a simple text document so i'm just


33
08:25:06,552 --> 08:25:11,760
going to use um normal text edit on macintosh even if you're linux for


34
08:25:11,760 --> 08:25:16,552
instance you can just use vim and create or vi you can create a simple document


35
08:25:16,552 --> 08:25:21,192
and let's i'm just going to basically copy this and paste it in here and i say


36
08:25:21,192 --> 08:25:26,080
contact support and thank you for using my awesome


37
08:25:26,080 --> 08:25:28,552
notes because that's the name of our


38
08:25:28,552 --> 08:25:33,440
application right it is my awesome notes so i'm going to save this document and


39
08:25:33,440 --> 08:25:37,680
i'm just going to say in here let's call it


40
08:25:37,680 --> 08:25:41,440
my awesome notes txt and i'm going to save it on


41
08:25:41,440 --> 08:25:46,232
desktop save all right did it not save it


42
08:25:46,232 --> 08:25:49,592
it is a little bit strange that it didn't save it so


43
08:25:49,592 --> 08:25:52,400
let me go back to this text now it saved it


44
08:25:52,400 --> 08:25:57,280
yeah it is right here okay so this is a document now text file simple and i'm


45
08:25:57,280 --> 08:26:01,592
going to go to my website control panel as you can see here there's a support


46
08:26:01,592 --> 08:26:03,680
folder so i'm going to go into the support


47
08:26:03,680 --> 08:26:07,760
folder and as you can see i already have four text files in this pixelity se


48
08:26:07,760 --> 08:26:12,320
website and i'm just going to hopefully be able to drag a file in


49
08:26:12,320 --> 08:26:17,440
there or maybe even upload so i'm going to drag this file boom


50
08:26:17,440 --> 08:26:21,440
and i can see it has uploaded now and


51
08:26:21,440 --> 08:26:25,832
seems to be it to be honest so let me just go back and see i'm my


52
08:26:25,832 --> 08:26:29,512
awesomenotes text file right there and i'm then going to go in here and see


53
08:26:29,512 --> 08:26:34,000
it's actually uploaded my awesome notes


54
08:26:34,000 --> 08:26:37,760
txt and i can actually see it is uploaded


55
08:26:37,760 --> 08:26:41,760
and it's there so if you don't have a website which you


56
08:26:41,760 --> 08:26:46,232
should if you're developing applications for ios and android or even if you're


57
08:26:46,232 --> 08:26:49,440
developing any applications and putting it out for customers you should have


58
08:26:49,440 --> 08:26:53,760
your own website and they're like very cheap ways of grabbing


59
08:26:53,760 --> 08:26:57,592
a website with cheap hosting i don't want to go and like


60
08:26:57,592 --> 08:27:02,000
sponsor various services and i'm even not even gonna name what i'm using but


61
08:27:02,000 --> 08:27:06,872
you can google that or just search online for a cheap hosting


62
08:27:06,872 --> 08:27:11,192
and creating a website of your own okay but since this is the outside that's


63
08:27:11,192 --> 08:27:15,120
outside the scope of this course i'm not going to talk so much about that okay so


64
08:27:15,120 --> 08:27:19,192
now we have this my awesome notes and what we need to do


65
08:27:19,192 --> 08:27:23,760
is to go ahead and add this support url so i'm going to copy it here and go to


66
08:27:23,760 --> 08:27:27,512
app store connect and in the support url i'm just gonna save it there i'm gonna


67
08:27:27,512 --> 08:27:31,280
press the save button okay so


68
08:27:31,280 --> 08:27:35,512
that's that and we also need to make sure that we add some other information


69
08:27:35,512 --> 08:27:40,640
in here promotional text description and also keywords and etc okay so


70
08:27:40,640 --> 08:27:44,552
these things are very important and we need to make sure that we fill these out


71
08:27:44,552 --> 08:27:50,400
so um let's see actually here okay so in the promotional text let's just


72
08:27:50,400 --> 08:27:52,960
enter in some information here as you can see this commercial text lets you


73
08:27:52,960 --> 08:27:56,320
inform your app store visitors of any current app features without requiring


74
08:27:56,320 --> 08:27:59,440
an updated submission okay so let's just say


75
08:27:59,440 --> 08:28:03,440
use my awesome notes


76
08:28:03,440 --> 08:28:08,800
in order to securely store your notes in the cloud


77
08:28:08,800 --> 08:28:14,552
all right and description and this app sim this free app allows you


78
08:28:14,552 --> 08:28:18,552
to store your notes securely on the cloud


79
08:28:18,552 --> 08:28:20,400
and um


80
08:28:20,400 --> 08:28:23,360
and that's it i mean they're very similar to each other but that's okay


81
08:28:23,360 --> 08:28:26,160
too and for the keywords in here you have to


82
08:28:26,160 --> 08:28:30,160
enter i think up to it doesn't really say how many yes 100


83
08:28:30,160 --> 08:28:33,512
characters you have and you have to like comma separate your keywords in here so


84
08:28:33,512 --> 08:28:38,080
i'm just going to say and notes and secure


85
08:28:38,080 --> 08:28:40,720
wow and make sure you don't have to actually


86
08:28:40,720 --> 08:28:45,120
have um let's see boom


87
08:28:45,120 --> 08:28:47,912
i don't think you have to have space between them and i'm just going to leave


88
08:28:47,912 --> 08:28:52,232
it like a notes secure cloud okay these are my keywords so


89
08:28:52,232 --> 08:28:55,512
i'm going to save this and remember we're in here in the ios prepare for


90
08:28:55,512 --> 08:28:58,800
submission section so that's also done


91
08:28:58,800 --> 08:29:04,872
and our app version is right there copyright we can just say 2022 pixelity


92
08:29:04,872 --> 08:29:06,872
uh a b


93
08:29:06,872 --> 08:29:11,360
all rights reserved


94
08:29:11,360 --> 08:29:14,640
okay these are just big words don't worry about it


95
08:29:14,640 --> 08:29:19,592
and um and that is pretty much it so


96
08:29:19,592 --> 08:29:23,120
um i don't think we need to do so much more


97
08:29:23,120 --> 08:29:27,592
to be honest with you in here and uh we don't even have to have the


98
08:29:27,592 --> 08:29:30,400
signing required for now and


99
08:29:30,400 --> 08:29:34,640
let's see and also need to go to contact information in here so let's say


100
08:29:34,640 --> 08:29:37,680
vandal and my


101
08:29:37,680 --> 08:29:42,320
last name and then i'm going to enter some


102
08:29:42,320 --> 08:29:46,512
fake phone number right now


103
08:29:46,872 --> 08:29:52,552
something like that and here's my support at pixelity


104
08:29:52,552 --> 08:29:55,512
and like that no signing required


105
08:29:55,512 --> 08:29:58,960
and here where we have the version release as you can see it says this app


106
08:29:58,960 --> 08:30:01,832
version can be automatically released right after it has been approved so


107
08:30:01,832 --> 08:30:05,040
there you have a few abilities to


108
08:30:05,040 --> 08:30:07,832
how you want to actually release your application so after you send your


109
08:30:07,832 --> 08:30:11,680
binary to apple you can choose for apple to either automatically release this


110
08:30:11,680 --> 08:30:14,800
version to all your users in the app store or


111
08:30:14,800 --> 08:30:17,360
you can say manually release this version meaning that after your


112
08:30:17,360 --> 08:30:20,720
application has been accepted by apple and approved by apple


113
08:30:20,720 --> 08:30:24,552
you can go manually press the release button wherever whenever it suits you


114
08:30:24,552 --> 08:30:27,120
best or you can say automatically release


115
08:30:27,120 --> 08:30:31,440
this version after app review no earlier now so you can set a date for it but


116
08:30:31,440 --> 08:30:34,232
we're gonna say manually release this version okay


117
08:30:34,232 --> 08:30:38,232
and after all of this i'm just gonna save this information right there and


118
08:30:38,232 --> 08:30:45,912
let's now go to app privacy so this is also very important to remember to do


119
08:30:45,912 --> 08:30:49,360
because i don't think


120
08:30:49,360 --> 08:30:52,720
um that we have actually


121
08:30:52,720 --> 08:30:57,120
yeah i actually believe here now that i can see that i've prepared some


122
08:30:57,120 --> 08:31:00,872
information about this in the upcoming chapter so


123
08:31:00,872 --> 08:31:06,080
we're going to take care of privacy policy in the next chapter so but know


124
08:31:06,080 --> 08:31:09,760
that it exists right there and we have to fix it soon


125
08:31:09,760 --> 08:31:13,760
so then what we need to do is to actually make a build for apple because


126
08:31:13,760 --> 08:31:18,400
this is like the most important part and and you need to make sure that you


127
08:31:18,400 --> 08:31:22,872
followed like the first chapters of this course where i talked about preparing


128
08:31:22,872 --> 08:31:27,360
our application for ios there is a chapter in the beginning of this course


129
08:31:27,360 --> 08:31:31,192
where we actually talk about creating our certificates and profiles and all of


130
08:31:31,192 --> 08:31:34,800
that for for ios distribution so i'm assuming


131
08:31:34,800 --> 08:31:38,160
you've already gone through that so we don't have to take care of that now all


132
08:31:38,160 --> 08:31:42,960
right so let's go now to our application in xcode let's see if i can bring up


133
08:31:42,960 --> 08:31:47,512
xcode it is somewhere around here


134
08:31:47,512 --> 08:31:52,232
so there is our application and i'm just going to go into runner and have a look


135
08:31:52,232 --> 08:31:56,160
at signing and capabilities and release and i can see that there is absolutely


136
08:31:56,160 --> 08:32:00,552
no problem with this production certificate and profile so what we need


137
08:32:00,552 --> 08:32:04,232
to do in here to make a release for app store is just to have a look at our


138
08:32:04,232 --> 08:32:09,192
runner and here change the target to for instance any ios device


139
08:32:09,192 --> 08:32:13,592
and then we go to product and then we say archive so


140
08:32:13,592 --> 08:32:19,680
this archiving is then in turn gonna create an ipa file for us and as i


141
08:32:19,680 --> 08:32:22,640
mentioned in the beginning of this chapter and this is the ipa file that


142
08:32:22,640 --> 08:32:25,912
we're going to submit to apple and


143
08:32:25,912 --> 08:32:28,640
xcode is going to help you a lot with that


144
08:32:28,640 --> 08:32:33,040
i'm not sure if i'm a fan of that to be honest with you i think xcode hides a


145
08:32:33,040 --> 08:32:36,480
lot of details and usually i'm used to like doing things in the command line


146
08:32:36,480 --> 08:32:39,680
and doing things simply from visual studio code for instance


147
08:32:39,680 --> 08:32:42,960
but it is still a good thing that xcode is going to help you submit your


148
08:32:42,960 --> 08:32:47,040
application because in the previous versions of xcode like


149
08:32:47,040 --> 08:32:50,552
many many years ago xcode couldn't do this so you had a separate application


150
08:32:50,552 --> 08:32:57,360
to actually upload your ipa files to app and that in itself was also quite


151
08:32:57,360 --> 08:33:00,872
a i wouldn't say a negative body was


152
08:33:00,872 --> 08:33:03,592
something that you have to go through so


153
08:33:03,592 --> 08:33:07,680
it is a plus and a minus that xcode is going to take care of all of these in my


154
08:33:07,680 --> 08:33:12,000
opinion at least so i'm just going to wait here for xcode to


155
08:33:12,000 --> 08:33:16,160
do its work and it is very possible that if


156
08:33:16,160 --> 08:33:19,912
this is the first time that you're archiving your application with the


157
08:33:19,912 --> 08:33:22,400
certificates that you


158
08:33:22,400 --> 08:33:26,320
basically created in the beginning of this course it's very possible that


159
08:33:26,320 --> 08:33:31,192
when the time comes for xcode to actually sign your binary and all its


160
08:33:31,192 --> 08:33:35,680
other related libraries it's possible that your macintosh is


161
08:33:35,680 --> 08:33:40,000
going to ask you for the password to this certificate and


162
08:33:40,000 --> 08:33:44,080
actually it's going to ask you for the password to the keychain


163
08:33:44,080 --> 08:33:49,680
in which on your computer this certificate is stored so this is usually


164
08:33:49,680 --> 08:33:54,232
the login keychain so if i go to keychain access in here you'll see that


165
08:33:54,232 --> 08:33:58,800
i have my login keychain and i have certificates in here as you can see


166
08:33:58,800 --> 08:34:01,760
distribution so this is the sort that i'm at the moment


167
08:34:01,760 --> 08:34:06,480
using for duplication and um after assigning this as you can see it's


168
08:34:06,480 --> 08:34:10,320
archiving right hasn't really signed things it's very possible that my


169
08:34:10,320 --> 08:34:15,360
macintosh is going to ask me for the password to that keychain so


170
08:34:15,360 --> 08:34:20,400
it's very close now to finishing the archiving process so


171
08:34:20,400 --> 08:34:24,552
excuse me so let's see basically how it goes after


172
08:34:24,552 --> 08:34:28,800
after doing that after actually creating our application ipa file we're going to


173
08:34:28,800 --> 08:34:35,120
submit it to apple and that app is going to be displayed then first inside here


174
08:34:35,120 --> 08:34:39,832
in the build section of your applications


175
08:34:39,832 --> 08:34:43,120
store connect view


176
08:34:43,120 --> 08:34:48,320
so let's see if we get this password for signing as i've mentioned here


177
08:34:48,320 --> 08:34:57,120
at the bottom of the screen so 4660 or 70 files out of 5039 files to


178
08:34:57,120 --> 08:35:01,760
compile and creating our binary so it's very very


179
08:35:01,760 --> 08:35:06,160
close let's just see if it can succeed in doing that


180
08:35:06,160 --> 08:35:11,912
and i can hear my macintosh um and fans going full speed right now and


181
08:35:11,912 --> 08:35:15,832
that's usually something you don't hear on the latest uh


182
08:35:15,832 --> 08:35:20,320
max or macbook pros because they're usually so silent like the fan almost


183
08:35:20,320 --> 08:35:23,680
never kicks in but this is apparently such a heavy


184
08:35:23,680 --> 08:35:30,160
process for this macintosh to perform the faster googling full speed so


185
08:35:30,160 --> 08:35:34,552
let's see if it succeeds all right and here is where we're seeing


186
08:35:34,552 --> 08:35:37,760
that dialogue that i was talking about as you can see it says code sign wants


187
08:35:37,760 --> 08:35:42,160
to sign using your van.hawa nippor in your keychain to allow this enter the


188
08:35:42,160 --> 08:35:45,760
login keychains password so it has nothing to do with your certificate it's


189
08:35:45,760 --> 08:35:49,192
just actually has everything to do with your certificate but the password itself


190
08:35:49,192 --> 08:35:53,592
is the login keychains password so it's usually your computer's password so


191
08:35:53,592 --> 08:35:57,912
i'm just going to enter that and then i'm going to say always allow


192
08:35:57,912 --> 08:36:03,120
all right so after doing that hopefully xcode is not


193
08:36:03,120 --> 08:36:06,800
going to bother me with this password again however i know in some older


194
08:36:06,800 --> 08:36:10,000
versions of xcode it doesn't really understand when you


195
08:36:10,000 --> 08:36:13,760
say always allow so when it comes to signing your application you may have to


196
08:36:13,760 --> 08:36:17,192
enter your password up to like 20 times depending


197
08:36:17,192 --> 08:36:20,160
on how many libraries your application depends on so


198
08:36:20,160 --> 08:36:24,080
i remember this vividly when i was working at a company and a tester i was


199
08:36:24,080 --> 08:36:27,912
telling that tester how to compile an archive an application for


200
08:36:27,912 --> 08:36:31,680
ios and we both thought that he's entering his password for his


201
08:36:31,680 --> 08:36:35,832
certificate incorrectly so and here now we got


202
08:36:35,832 --> 08:36:41,912
module shareplus not found and what could that be because shareplus is


203
08:36:41,912 --> 08:36:45,592
basically something that we're using in our application


204
08:36:45,592 --> 08:36:48,800
as and it's continuing to archive even


205
08:36:48,800 --> 08:36:52,400
though it it says that something's failed so all right so now we got an


206
08:36:52,400 --> 08:36:56,640
issue here with pods runner framework and this could seem i mean i'm actually


207
08:36:56,640 --> 08:36:59,192
quite glad that we're getting these errors and that could some and be


208
08:36:59,192 --> 08:37:04,160
because we haven't done a proper pod install so what i'm gonna do is go to


209
08:37:04,160 --> 08:37:08,400
visual studio code here and in the terminal then let me actually change the


210
08:37:08,400 --> 08:37:10,872
screen layout a little bit so you see what i'm doing


211
08:37:10,872 --> 08:37:13,592
so i'm gonna bring this up so you see better what i'm doing and i'm going to


212
08:37:13,592 --> 08:37:18,160
go to the ios folder here


213
08:37:18,160 --> 08:37:22,640
okay and then in here you could just say pod d integrate


214
08:37:22,640 --> 08:37:26,640
basically pod the integrate it's going to remove all your ios dependencies from


215
08:37:26,640 --> 08:37:29,832
your workspace and then you could just say pawn install okay


216
08:37:29,832 --> 08:37:33,760
and this is gonna reinstall all your dependencies from scratch so


217
08:37:33,760 --> 08:37:37,832
let's see and i can see share plus is actually installed now so it's


218
08:37:37,832 --> 08:37:40,720
generating the pods project and


219
08:37:40,720 --> 08:37:45,440
great so that seems to be fine so let's go in here and see if we can


220
08:37:45,440 --> 08:37:52,640
uh do a clean so i'm gonna go to debug sra product clean build folder and let's


221
08:37:52,640 --> 08:37:56,552
see if we can make a fresh build and this could actually take some time


222
08:37:56,552 --> 08:38:01,512
because now we've really uh cleaned the build art artifact so


223
08:38:01,512 --> 08:38:05,832
it's gonna basically start the archiving process from absolute beginning so


224
08:38:05,832 --> 08:38:09,832
i'm just gonna be quiet for a while and let us do its work and let's see if the


225
08:38:09,832 --> 08:38:14,960
archiving process succeeds okay so here's the result of actually


226
08:38:14,960 --> 08:38:19,040
archiving our application again and we're seeing the exact same problem now


227
08:38:19,040 --> 08:38:24,160
after doing a podly integrate and also doing a completely new pod install so


228
08:38:24,160 --> 08:38:28,400
we're seeing the exact same problem with share plus say module share plus not


229
08:38:28,400 --> 08:38:33,912
found and this could be a problem with how we've done for instance our


230
08:38:33,912 --> 08:38:36,800
um pub get


231
08:38:36,800 --> 08:38:40,872
and to be honest with you i could cut this out of this whole video but i'm so


232
08:38:40,872 --> 08:38:44,640
so glad that we're seeing these problems because


233
08:38:44,640 --> 08:38:48,800
archiving an ios application and simply it's


234
08:38:48,800 --> 08:38:52,160
not always going to go fine even just doing the same thing for android it's


235
08:38:52,160 --> 08:38:56,080
not always going to go fine and if i cut this out of this video you you


236
08:38:56,080 --> 08:38:58,872
will be thinking that everything is going fine for me but things are not


237
08:38:58,872 --> 08:39:02,400
working for you and then you'll start blaming yourself but i really want to


238
08:39:02,400 --> 08:39:07,512
keep these stuff in this course so you see that well a person like me trying to


239
08:39:07,512 --> 08:39:12,000
tell you how to do things also needs to understand himself how and why these


240
08:39:12,000 --> 08:39:16,480
things are going wrong so in my guess in this case since we've


241
08:39:16,480 --> 08:39:20,400
already done a pod install it would be to actually go and clear the


242
08:39:20,400 --> 08:39:24,552
build folder for our entire flutter application and also do a


243
08:39:24,552 --> 08:39:29,440
flutter pop get from scratch so let's go ahead in our flutter


244
08:39:29,440 --> 08:39:34,160
application in here and at the bottom i'm just going to say fluffer clean


245
08:39:34,160 --> 08:39:37,912
and that's going to clean the artifacts for ios and android


246
08:39:37,912 --> 08:39:40,480
okay and then you're going to get a lot of


247
08:39:40,480 --> 08:39:44,232
errors in your application because then it doesn't understand anything so we


248
08:39:44,232 --> 08:39:49,440
then say flutter pop get all right


249
08:39:49,440 --> 08:39:53,040
so that's gonna do its work and get all your dependencies from scratch basically


250
08:39:53,040 --> 08:39:58,480
and install them in your application all right then what i'm gonna do in here


251
08:39:58,480 --> 08:40:01,192
is to yeah we could just leave it like that


252
08:40:01,192 --> 08:40:06,872
now and go back to our xcode and then try to archive the application from


253
08:40:06,872 --> 08:40:11,592
scratch let's see let's see if this time it goes a little bit better and


254
08:40:11,592 --> 08:40:16,872
hopefully it shouldn't take so much time this time but you never know with xcode


255
08:40:16,872 --> 08:40:20,160
and with ios development it has its own


256
08:40:20,160 --> 08:40:24,800
antiques so let's just wait and see after doing a pop get if this process is


257
08:40:24,800 --> 08:40:29,592
going to go through or not so after xcode has compiled the application again


258
08:40:29,592 --> 08:40:34,160
i could see the same problems as as we had before so meaning that our pod the


259
08:40:34,160 --> 08:40:38,080
integrate and flutter clean really didn't have so much effect on the


260
08:40:38,080 --> 08:40:42,000
application itself now since i've been doing ios development for a very long


261
08:40:42,000 --> 08:40:47,120
time i still have some tools in my in my belt that i can drag out and use


262
08:40:47,120 --> 08:40:51,592
and one of the first things i would use as a software engineer and an ios


263
08:40:51,592 --> 08:40:54,232
developer is just to first have a look at


264
08:40:54,232 --> 08:40:59,360
our deployment ios version and here we're supporting ios 9 and it's very


265
08:40:59,360 --> 08:41:03,912
well possible that this sharing capability that is built into


266
08:41:03,912 --> 08:41:07,120
the plugin that we're dragging into our application isn't compatible with this


267
08:41:07,120 --> 08:41:10,720
ios version so first i'm going to bump this to ios 13


268
08:41:10,720 --> 08:41:15,280
at the moment at the their ios 13 14 and 50 are very popular so there are the


269
08:41:15,280 --> 08:41:19,760
latest versions of ios at the time of recording this um course so first i'm


270
08:41:19,760 --> 08:41:23,512
going to do that the next thing that i'm going to do is


271
08:41:23,512 --> 08:41:29,120
to from our project in here so i'm having a look here as you can see i'm in


272
08:41:29,120 --> 08:41:34,160
the ios folder of this notes project so let's go in there


273
08:41:34,160 --> 08:41:39,832
then the first thing i'm going to do is to perhaps remove the um i wonder if i


274
08:41:39,832 --> 08:41:43,040
should actually remove the pod file as well


275
08:41:43,040 --> 08:41:49,360
maybe let's just remove the podfile.lock and remove also all the pots from the


276
08:41:49,360 --> 08:41:55,592
project okay so then i'm gonna do fluster clean in here


277
08:41:55,592 --> 08:41:59,760
that removed really all the pots from the project


278
08:41:59,760 --> 08:42:06,080
and then after undoing that i'm going to have actually a look at our pot file to


279
08:42:06,080 --> 08:42:10,800
have a look at all our ios dependencies and see how they look like so i'm going


280
08:42:10,800 --> 08:42:15,120
to stop the execution of the program and then i'm going to open a file called pod


281
08:42:15,120 --> 08:42:18,872
file and this is where all your ios dependencies basically are stored as you


282
08:42:18,872 --> 08:42:23,592
can see the platform is ios 13. so it was strange that our deployment target


283
08:42:23,592 --> 08:42:27,440
was ios 9 so this could be a potential source of problem


284
08:42:27,440 --> 08:42:32,640
and after doing that then we have our pod file and yeah this this looks fine


285
08:42:32,640 --> 08:42:38,000
as it is so um let's then go after into the terminal


286
08:42:38,000 --> 08:42:41,280
and after flats are clean let's just say flop


287
08:42:41,280 --> 08:42:45,592
flutter pop get which is going to redrag


288
08:42:45,592 --> 08:42:50,480
our dependencies into our flutter project and ios project for instance


289
08:42:50,480 --> 08:42:55,760
then and we can then go back i'm actually going to kill xcode and open


290
08:42:55,760 --> 08:43:00,000
the ios folder and open the


291
08:43:00,232 --> 08:43:04,800
project workspace again and i can see here at the moment the pods aren't


292
08:43:04,800 --> 08:43:09,192
really installed so let's go and do the installation of pods ourselves so i'm


293
08:43:09,192 --> 08:43:13,280
going to say pod install this is going to install all the dependencies and


294
08:43:13,280 --> 08:43:17,360
let's have a look in here and say what it is talking about


295
08:43:17,360 --> 08:43:21,192
cloud fire support as far as store using firebase is defining okay those all look


296
08:43:21,192 --> 08:43:24,552
fine here says coco pods didn't see the base configuration of your project


297
08:43:24,552 --> 08:43:28,160
because your project already has a custom config set in order for cocoapods


298
08:43:28,160 --> 08:43:31,912
integration to work at all please either set the base configuration of the target


299
08:43:31,912 --> 08:43:37,440
runner to target support files blah blah blah or include the target support files


300
08:43:37,440 --> 08:43:41,512
in your build configuration so this could actually be very important as we


301
08:43:41,512 --> 08:43:46,000
can see in here so maybe there was a problem in setting up our


302
08:43:46,000 --> 08:43:50,552
project with flutter create when we said we created our application to begin with


303
08:43:50,552 --> 08:43:55,592
but let's just keep this in mind and try to


304
08:43:56,480 --> 08:44:01,192
go in here and open our workspace one more time and now i can see all the pods


305
08:44:01,192 --> 08:44:05,512
are in here development pods okay


306
08:44:05,512 --> 08:44:10,960
share plus is right there pod okay and the pod spec what is the pod spec


307
08:44:10,960 --> 08:44:14,960
says it actually says the platform should be ios 8 so it supports ios 8 so


308
08:44:14,960 --> 08:44:18,800
that's not a problem so what i'm going to do now is after doing all these


309
08:44:18,800 --> 08:44:22,232
things i'm going to basically try to build this project again so i'm going to


310
08:44:22,232 --> 08:44:28,000
do a clean here clean build folder with command shift k so blink basically clean


311
08:44:28,000 --> 08:44:33,512
your build folder and all while all of this is going on


312
08:44:33,512 --> 08:44:38,400
editor functionality that's that's fine so i'm going to basically start doing a


313
08:44:38,400 --> 08:44:42,552
um product and archive again and then i'll


314
08:44:42,552 --> 08:44:46,160
see you on the other side either this succeeds or fails and if it fails we're


315
08:44:46,160 --> 08:44:50,480
gonna fix it so let's have a look okay now i can see


316
08:44:50,480 --> 08:44:54,320
after doing all the gymnastics that i just had to do


317
08:44:54,320 --> 08:44:59,280
then our application has finally compiled without a problem and to be


318
08:44:59,280 --> 08:45:02,400
honest with you this is one of the things that i believe many courses are


319
08:45:02,400 --> 08:45:06,080
missing in that when you go through distributing your


320
08:45:06,080 --> 08:45:09,912
application you actually go through a lot it's not just that you press a


321
08:45:09,912 --> 08:45:13,832
button and submit your application and you're done well usually if everything


322
08:45:13,832 --> 08:45:18,160
is set up correctly then that is the case however you have to set up


323
08:45:18,160 --> 08:45:21,680
everything correctly so what happened in here is that we have


324
08:45:21,680 --> 08:45:28,400
to issue a few things what i did just to name them step by step is that i


325
08:45:28,400 --> 08:45:32,320
first bumped the deployment target of our application


326
08:45:32,320 --> 08:45:37,912
from 9 to 13. so you can find that by clicking on your workspace in xcode then


327
08:45:37,912 --> 08:45:42,640
clicking on your runner target general tab in here and then the deployment


328
08:45:42,640 --> 08:45:47,040
information i bumped it to ios 13 so that's the first thing that i that i did


329
08:45:47,040 --> 08:45:50,552
however i don't think that that necessarily had anything to do with


330
08:45:50,552 --> 08:45:54,160
fixing this problem the other thing that we did from


331
08:45:54,160 --> 08:45:58,320
terminal was to clean all our pots and i did that by saying


332
08:45:58,320 --> 08:46:03,360
rmrf pods now we issued that command from the ios


333
08:46:03,360 --> 08:46:07,760
folder if i open this ios folder you'll see that there is a folder in here


334
08:46:07,760 --> 08:46:12,960
called pods what are pods pods are basically your applications dependencies


335
08:46:12,960 --> 08:46:18,320
for ios that's how flutter manages your ios application dependencies so all


336
08:46:18,320 --> 08:46:22,320
these libraries for instance like firebase and this sharing library that


337
08:46:22,320 --> 08:46:27,912
we just dragged in they're using basically they are dependencies that


338
08:46:27,912 --> 08:46:32,800
flutter manages using cocoapods which is a third-party software and you have to


339
08:46:32,800 --> 08:46:36,552
have cocoapods installed on your computer in order to even be able to


340
08:46:36,552 --> 08:46:40,552
interact with pods so there's lots of information on the internet on how to


341
08:46:40,552 --> 08:46:44,800
install cocoapods but it's usually pseudo jam install cocoapods and i think


342
08:46:44,800 --> 08:46:49,680
maybe you can even use homebrew to install cocoapods but i usually use


343
08:46:49,680 --> 08:46:53,040
sudo jam or jam in this case but you need sudo


344
08:46:53,040 --> 08:46:57,192
usually to install cocoapods so so what we did we removed the pots


345
08:46:57,192 --> 08:47:01,360
folder we removed the podfile lock which for you who are like comfortable with


346
08:47:01,360 --> 08:47:05,192
backing the web development with npm this is this is like your package lock


347
08:47:05,192 --> 08:47:08,640
file and if you're not comfortable with back-end development basically a pod


348
08:47:08,640 --> 08:47:14,160
file lock is a file that stores information about all your dependencies


349
08:47:14,160 --> 08:47:19,512
which are currently installed whereas the pod file stores information


350
08:47:19,512 --> 08:47:24,800
about which dependencies you need and pod file log stores information about


351
08:47:24,800 --> 08:47:30,000
the ones that are integrated right now into your application so we remove that


352
08:47:30,000 --> 08:47:33,440
just to ensure that on the next pod install


353
08:47:33,440 --> 08:47:37,592
all our dependencies will be freshly installed and regardless of what is


354
08:47:37,592 --> 08:47:41,592
inside the pod file lock so there were a few steps that we had to


355
08:47:41,592 --> 08:47:46,160
take but finally we manage oh also we don't forget flutter clean we also


356
08:47:46,160 --> 08:47:50,000
issued flutter clean so after all these steps we finally managed


357
08:47:50,000 --> 08:47:54,400
to build our application and as you saw in this screen we came to this archive


358
08:47:54,400 --> 08:47:58,800
section so i want to have a look a little bit here


359
08:47:58,800 --> 08:48:01,832
at my notes to see


360
08:48:01,832 --> 08:48:05,120
um so yeah we've done the password signing


361
08:48:05,120 --> 08:48:09,280
etc etc and now we basically um


362
08:48:09,280 --> 08:48:13,760
basically created this ipa file in here so one you need to do


363
08:48:13,760 --> 08:48:17,192
in here then you press the distribute app button and say app store connect and


364
08:48:17,192 --> 08:48:20,872
say send send and this is going to do some analysis on


365
08:48:20,872 --> 08:48:25,512
that binary for you and it's this is going to connect to app


366
08:48:25,512 --> 08:48:29,192
store connect and some of you in here may immediately


367
08:48:29,192 --> 08:48:32,872
get an error saying that well i don't know how to connect and that's because


368
08:48:32,872 --> 08:48:35,832
you haven't entered your um


369
08:48:35,832 --> 08:48:39,680
profile information in xcode if you go to xcode preferences there is a section


370
08:48:39,680 --> 08:48:44,800
called accounts and you need to ensure that you basically add your app apple id


371
08:48:44,800 --> 08:48:47,760
with your account in xcode for any of that


372
08:48:47,760 --> 08:48:51,120
for the distribution to actually work at all so i'm going to say app store


373
08:48:51,120 --> 08:48:56,232
connect here and next upload to app store connect next


374
08:48:56,232 --> 08:48:59,192
so let's go in there


375
08:49:03,120 --> 08:49:07,360
okay and it says okay upload your app symbols


376
08:49:07,360 --> 08:49:10,640
manage version and build number i don't really like that so we're gonna take


377
08:49:10,640 --> 08:49:13,280
that off so we're not gonna use that okay


378
08:49:13,280 --> 08:49:17,512
and let me just make the screen a little bit bigger and press next in here and


379
08:49:17,512 --> 08:49:22,552
here you have to select your uh profile and seems fine


380
08:49:22,552 --> 08:49:26,640
press the next button in there and this is going to contact app store connect


381
08:49:26,640 --> 08:49:31,280
and depending on your application size this could actually take quite a long


382
08:49:31,280 --> 08:49:35,280
time for some of the applications that i'm working on


383
08:49:35,280 --> 08:49:40,480
not personally but for various companies even with my thousand thousand download


384
08:49:40,480 --> 08:49:43,440
upload um [Music]


385
08:49:43,440 --> 08:49:48,080
internet connection this process could take a long time so let's see how long


386
08:49:48,080 --> 08:49:51,192
it takes because you see during the upload process it's not just uploading


387
08:49:51,192 --> 08:49:54,320
your binary it's actually contacting apple and


388
08:49:54,320 --> 08:49:58,800
even validating a lot of your assets like your images it's valuing your icons


389
08:49:58,800 --> 08:50:03,120
it's valid validating even if you have other resources in your application and


390
08:50:03,120 --> 08:50:06,400
i believe it even checks like if you're making any


391
08:50:06,400 --> 08:50:10,640
api calls which you shouldn't be making and i'm not talking about network api


392
08:50:10,640 --> 08:50:14,800
calls but i'm actually talking about ios sdk api calls for instance if you've


393
08:50:14,800 --> 08:50:20,232
hidden some work in your application which is making uh calls to some um


394
08:50:20,232 --> 08:50:26,720
private apis at the ios sdk level so now we're just gonna let it do its thing


395
08:50:26,720 --> 08:50:31,832
and upload and um we'll just wait until it's done


396
08:50:31,832 --> 08:50:35,832
okay well the upload process seems to have gone


397
08:50:35,832 --> 08:50:42,080
actually a lot better this time and um and i actually have to really confess to


398
08:50:42,080 --> 08:50:46,800
something in here in that the upload process for me took a very


399
08:50:46,800 --> 08:50:51,512
very very long time i'm talking about upwards of 30 minutes even though i'm on


400
08:50:51,512 --> 08:50:55,192
a thousand thousand um fiber optic


401
08:50:55,192 --> 08:51:00,232
download the upload speed um for my internet connection this still took a


402
08:51:00,232 --> 08:51:05,512
long time and this could either be a temporary bug a glitch on apple on


403
08:51:05,512 --> 08:51:09,192
apple's app store connect website or it could just be something that well from


404
08:51:09,192 --> 08:51:13,280
now on things are gonna take a long time you never know what apple so


405
08:51:13,280 --> 08:51:18,000
that's unfortunate but at the moment it's gone through and i can see that um


406
08:51:18,000 --> 08:51:22,000
you will get this message telling you that your app was uploaded successfully


407
08:51:22,000 --> 08:51:26,720
okay now let's talk about a um


408
08:51:26,720 --> 08:51:31,832
a push notification email that you'll receive from apple that will look like


409
08:51:31,832 --> 08:51:35,192
this after submitting your application you will probably receive an email from


410
08:51:35,192 --> 08:51:40,232
apple that looks kind of like this and in here as you'll see it says we i i


411
08:51:40,232 --> 08:51:43,360
want more issues with recent delivery of your application my awesome notes your


412
08:51:43,360 --> 08:51:45,680
delivery was successful but you mentioned you may wish to correct the


413
08:51:45,680 --> 08:51:49,280
following issues in your next lorry missing push notification entitlements


414
08:51:49,280 --> 08:51:52,400
and this may be a bit


415
08:51:52,400 --> 08:51:55,680
troubling for some developers but this is simply because we're at the moment


416
08:51:55,680 --> 08:51:58,872
using firebase in our application on firebase is


417
08:51:58,872 --> 08:52:02,080
able to handle push notifications so that you can send a push notification


418
08:52:02,080 --> 08:52:07,760
from firebase console to your users however our application isn't


419
08:52:07,760 --> 08:52:11,040
taking advantage of push notifications at the moment so


420
08:52:11,040 --> 08:52:14,552
you can just disregard this email and just


421
08:52:14,552 --> 08:52:18,960
don't try to even fix anything because all this email is saying is that we've


422
08:52:18,960 --> 08:52:22,872
analyzed your binary it looks like you are accessing some push notification


423
08:52:22,872 --> 08:52:27,680
apis however you forgot to enable push notifications for applications so and


424
08:52:27,680 --> 08:52:31,680
this is simply because when you bundle your application and send it to apple as


425
08:52:31,680 --> 08:52:34,720
an ipa which is something you probably didn't


426
08:52:34,720 --> 08:52:39,592
actually look at but if you go to visual studio code sorry if you go to xcode in


427
08:52:39,592 --> 08:52:42,720
this archive browser right click on your runner


428
08:52:42,720 --> 08:52:48,000
and here and say show in finder you'll see this xcode archive file and say show


429
08:52:48,000 --> 08:52:51,680
package contents and in here you'll probably see some products and


430
08:52:51,680 --> 08:52:56,800
applications run our app so this whole thing is like your ipa file that apple


431
08:52:56,800 --> 08:53:01,040
has received now in this runner application there is information about


432
08:53:01,040 --> 08:53:04,872
what kind of like libraries it has included in itself and you can actually


433
08:53:04,872 --> 08:53:08,320
right click on run or app and say show package contents and in here you'll see


434
08:53:08,320 --> 08:53:12,400
all the frameworks that your application ships with and you can see


435
08:53:12,400 --> 08:53:16,720
firebase etc etc so one of these frameworks


436
08:53:16,720 --> 08:53:21,680
most probably one of the firebase frameworks is internally using it has it


437
08:53:21,680 --> 08:53:24,720
is using some apis related to push notifications but that doesn't


438
08:53:24,720 --> 08:53:29,192
necessarily mean that it is active and it's actively being used


439
08:53:29,192 --> 08:53:33,592
so that's just an email that apple tells you that hey you may have forgotten to


440
08:53:33,592 --> 08:53:36,960
do something but you can just disregard from this email and say no i didn't


441
08:53:36,960 --> 08:53:40,640
forget anything because we don't have push notifications in our application


442
08:53:40,640 --> 08:53:44,720
okay so that's that email and


443
08:53:44,720 --> 08:53:48,000
um so that seems to be fine and after that


444
08:53:48,000 --> 08:53:51,360
email you'll probably also receive an email that looks like this telling you


445
08:53:51,360 --> 08:53:56,960
that hey your application with this sku has now been submitted and has completed


446
08:53:56,960 --> 08:54:01,280
processing and this this email literally means that after


447
08:54:01,280 --> 08:54:05,192
this application's finished processing you're able to install it on your ios or


448
08:54:05,192 --> 08:54:10,320
mac device and you can test it as you'll see in the next chapter but


449
08:54:10,320 --> 08:54:13,192
as we usually do in every chapter at the


450
08:54:13,192 --> 08:54:16,872
end of every chapter we commit to what we've done and we make sure that we


451
08:54:16,872 --> 08:54:21,120
commit and tag those changes so let me do some reshuffling on the screen


452
08:54:21,120 --> 08:54:24,232
here and let's go to and i'm going to close


453
08:54:24,232 --> 08:54:30,080
xcode here like that go to our application my notes to terminal and


454
08:54:30,080 --> 08:54:34,480
let's just see git status a few things change so i'm going to go


455
08:54:34,480 --> 08:54:37,912
cd get status in the main folder of our


456
08:54:37,912 --> 08:54:43,120
application my notes because i was in the ios folder so i just did cd dot dot


457
08:54:43,120 --> 08:54:46,720
like this so now i'm in the main folder grid status shows this and i'm just


458
08:54:46,720 --> 08:54:51,120
going to say git add all right and let's just have a look at our logs the last


459
08:54:51,120 --> 08:54:55,192
commit was step 28 so let's just think it's commit


460
08:54:55,192 --> 08:54:59,192
step 29 as a caption at the bottom screen indicates and we just push our


461
08:54:59,192 --> 08:55:03,120
changes after that is now let's just tag our


462
08:55:03,120 --> 08:55:07,592
changes as well and say step 29 and hit push


463
08:55:07,592 --> 08:55:14,160
tags just like that all right so that is now working as


464
08:55:14,160 --> 08:55:17,680
expected so what uh we usually at the end of it at


465
08:55:17,680 --> 08:55:20,400
the end of every chapter is that we talk about what we when we are going to


466
08:55:20,400 --> 08:55:24,800
discuss in the following chapter and what we need to do in the next chapter


467
08:55:24,800 --> 08:55:29,440
is actually release our ios application we've sent it now to apple and apple has


468
08:55:29,440 --> 08:55:34,960
finally finished processing that and build meaning that it's ready now to be


469
08:55:34,960 --> 08:55:38,720
actually submitted to apple and that's what we're going to do in the next


470
08:55:38,720 --> 08:55:43,440
chapter to submit the app for release to the app store so i'll see


471
08:55:43,440 --> 08:55:47,592
you there hello everyone and welcome to chapter 48 of this flutter course in


472
08:55:47,592 --> 08:55:50,000
previous chapters we've been working with


473
08:55:50,000 --> 08:55:54,800
creating an ipa file and sending it to apple and in this chapter we're going to


474
08:55:54,800 --> 08:55:58,960
make sure that we're releasing that ipa file meaning that we're going to tell


475
08:55:58,960 --> 08:56:02,872
apple that hey we're ready with this ipa file and we want you to


476
08:56:02,872 --> 08:56:06,872
um review this file for us and the review process


477
08:56:06,872 --> 08:56:11,360
for apple and and google are a little bit different in that for instance with


478
08:56:11,360 --> 08:56:15,280
apple sometimes uh there's an actual user looking at your application and


479
08:56:15,280 --> 08:56:20,400
sometimes if you for instance request a um a fast review from apple they may not


480
08:56:20,400 --> 08:56:24,000
even look at it and they may just say okay it just works it's it doesn't crash


481
08:56:24,000 --> 08:56:29,120
and then they it just goes through um and for google it could also be a


482
08:56:29,120 --> 08:56:32,080
completely different process but we're right now in this chapter we're


483
08:56:32,080 --> 08:56:37,360
going to focus on how ios app app submission basically works okay


484
08:56:37,360 --> 08:56:41,040
so when you send an ipa file like we've


485
08:56:41,040 --> 08:56:46,720
done to apple it will be available in a place called test flight so let me bring


486
08:56:46,720 --> 08:56:54,400
our web browser to the screen and let's go and see if we can if you can actually


487
08:56:54,640 --> 08:56:59,040
bring the views as we had before so let's see app


488
08:56:59,040 --> 08:57:03,280
store connect and i've restarted my computer since last time so i may have


489
08:57:03,280 --> 08:57:05,832
to basically


490
08:57:06,480 --> 08:57:10,232
log in again and thank god i didn't actually have to restart the whole


491
08:57:10,232 --> 08:57:14,080
process and actually grab my security key in here so


492
08:57:14,080 --> 08:57:17,760
it just allowed me to log in so let's go to my awesome apps in app store connect


493
08:57:17,760 --> 08:57:20,552
and then you'll see a tab up here called test flight


494
08:57:20,552 --> 08:57:25,120
and test flight as you'll see now our build then is available in here


495
08:57:25,120 --> 08:57:30,480
and it's ready to be tested basically so


496
08:57:30,480 --> 08:57:34,320
what we need to also do is to go in here in the missing compliance and then tap


497
08:57:34,320 --> 08:57:38,000
on this manage and it says does your app use encryption select yes


498
08:57:38,000 --> 08:57:41,680
and and it says export logs require that products containing encryption must be


499
08:57:41,680 --> 08:57:46,400
uh properly authorized so in here we could just say yes


500
08:57:46,400 --> 08:57:49,360
and it says export compliance does your app


501
08:57:49,360 --> 08:57:52,552
qualify for any of the exams provided in the category make sure that your app


502
08:57:52,552 --> 08:57:55,912
meets the criteria actually we could go previous and just say no in here because


503
08:57:55,912 --> 08:58:00,480
we're not directly using um if you it is your responsibility to


504
08:58:00,480 --> 08:58:03,680
comply with export regulation and you should revisit this question if your


505
08:58:03,680 --> 08:58:06,800
encryption exists i'll just say blah blah blah okay


506
08:58:06,800 --> 08:58:11,120
now okay and then we say start internal testing okay so now that compliance


507
08:58:11,120 --> 08:58:15,760
error is going to go away so now that we've done that you'll see


508
08:58:15,760 --> 08:58:19,440
that here in app store connect there is a section called test flight and in here


509
08:58:19,440 --> 08:58:24,080
you have the ability to for instance invite third-party testers


510
08:58:24,080 --> 08:58:28,800
to your um to test your application and you are


511
08:58:28,800 --> 08:58:34,080
also allowed to give access to your application to users


512
08:58:34,080 --> 08:58:38,232
who you've invited to app store connect so it is very very important to


513
08:58:38,232 --> 08:58:41,592
understand the difference one is internal testing and the other one is


514
08:58:41,592 --> 08:58:45,280
like if you want to submit your application to be tested by third


515
08:58:45,280 --> 08:58:48,960
parties like someone who doesn't work for your company for instance so in this


516
08:58:48,960 --> 08:58:52,552
case we're just going to use internal testing in this chapter but just know


517
08:58:52,552 --> 08:58:57,192
that test flight is on ios and mac os an application that


518
08:58:57,192 --> 08:59:00,160
you can actually download on those operating systems


519
08:59:00,160 --> 08:59:05,592
and you can use test flight in order to test your own ios applications or mac


520
08:59:05,592 --> 08:59:11,440
applications before you submit them to app store okay


521
08:59:11,440 --> 08:59:15,912
so that's where test flight now that we're talking all about all


522
08:59:15,912 --> 08:59:20,232
these let's just also make sure that we know we have a little bit of a security


523
08:59:20,232 --> 08:59:23,912
problem um we haven't really talked about it so


524
08:59:23,912 --> 08:59:30,400
much yet but i i built this um with uh uh in swedish you say midfield and that


525
08:59:30,400 --> 08:59:35,360
is like intentionally intentionally i built this into this course so you'll


526
08:59:35,360 --> 08:59:38,400
see how the resubmission process also works so


527
08:59:38,400 --> 08:59:43,280
if if we bring our code let's let's bring our mynotes code in here


528
08:59:43,280 --> 08:59:48,720
and have a look at our um i believe was one of our services


529
08:59:48,720 --> 08:59:51,192
notes service oops


530
08:59:51,192 --> 08:59:55,192
no service is completely oh because that was the crowd service so


531
08:59:55,192 --> 08:59:59,912
let's have a look at the service and cloud note and we have


532
08:59:59,912 --> 09:00:05,120
crowd cloud storage cloud firebase cloud storage it's called okay i'd forgotten


533
09:00:05,120 --> 09:00:10,400
the name and we had this little all field in here you see


534
09:00:10,400 --> 09:00:16,080
so what this all field at the moment is doing is saying that go get all the


535
09:00:16,080 --> 09:00:20,800
notes in all the notes in the notes collection


536
09:00:20,800 --> 09:00:25,912
so that's doing that and then from all the notes remember all the notes not


537
09:00:25,912 --> 09:00:30,720
only your notes it's taking and creating a cloud note


538
09:00:30,720 --> 09:00:37,040
and then it's filtering them out by who you are that is a huge security problem


539
09:00:37,040 --> 09:00:40,232
because by doing this subscription and getting


540
09:00:40,232 --> 09:00:44,160
this stream you're pretty much reading everyone else's notes as well what we


541
09:00:44,160 --> 09:00:48,400
want soon we're gonna fix that don't worry about it what we want is to not


542
09:00:48,400 --> 09:00:53,360
even allow any user to read someone else's notes okay and then we're going


543
09:00:53,360 --> 09:00:57,192
to change this implementation of all notes and resubmit


544
09:00:57,192 --> 09:00:59,592
our application to apple so


545
09:00:59,592 --> 09:01:03,120
i didn't want us to submit an app to apple and then to google and then have


546
09:01:03,120 --> 09:01:06,800
to resubmit it in both platforms because as i said planned this so i just wanted


547
09:01:06,800 --> 09:01:10,640
us to submit something only to one platform and then draw it back and then


548
09:01:10,640 --> 09:01:14,400
send it again but don't worry about this yet i'm just giving you some preparation


549
09:01:14,400 --> 09:01:18,000
of what's to come so


550
09:01:18,000 --> 09:01:21,272
what we need to do now first is to as the caption at the bottom of the screen


551
09:01:21,272 --> 09:01:25,760
in the case we need to install test flight for both ios and you also have to


552
09:01:25,760 --> 09:01:30,960
install it for um your mac on on the mac you can just go


553
09:01:30,960 --> 09:01:36,640
to app store on your macintosh so app store app and then search for test


554
09:01:36,640 --> 09:01:39,120
flight okay after


555
09:01:39,120 --> 09:01:42,960
search for test flight you can install it with this install button i have it


556
09:01:42,960 --> 09:01:46,552
installed already on my computer so i don't see a install button in here i can


557
09:01:46,552 --> 09:01:50,640
just open it and after you've done that um for your


558
09:01:50,640 --> 09:01:55,680
macintosh you'll also need to install it for your um


559
09:01:55,680 --> 09:02:01,120
ios device and here i actually have my iphone my little


560
09:02:01,120 --> 09:02:06,000
iphone 13 pro max here and i have i'm


561
09:02:06,000 --> 09:02:09,832
mirroring that iphone here on the screen as you can see so what you can see on


562
09:02:09,832 --> 09:02:12,552
the screen is actually my iphone right here okay


563
09:02:12,552 --> 09:02:17,272
and test flight is an application which is available right here so this is the


564
09:02:17,272 --> 09:02:20,800
test flight application on ios so at the moment you can see that i don't have


565
09:02:20,800 --> 09:02:26,160
access to my nodes application but we're going to fix that soon or my awesome


566
09:02:26,160 --> 09:02:30,800
notes as we call it okay so let's go ahead in here and have a


567
09:02:30,800 --> 09:02:34,232
look at the next thing we need to talk about and that's adding a user to to


568
09:02:34,232 --> 09:02:39,512
test light so how do i get access to um to


569
09:02:39,512 --> 09:02:44,160
this build that we've submitted so that i can test it with test flight well the


570
09:02:44,160 --> 09:02:48,872
user that i've used for testing in here and i know that user it's


571
09:02:48,872 --> 09:02:53,680
pixelity.sweden gmail.com so what i'm going to do now is


572
09:02:53,680 --> 09:02:58,480
to invite that user to test this build so let's go to internal testing and


573
09:02:58,480 --> 09:03:03,512
press the plus button and in here i'm just going to say my users okay


574
09:03:03,512 --> 09:03:07,912
and then press the create button and in here you'll see a plus button


575
09:03:07,912 --> 09:03:12,400
tester 0 and i'm just going to say plus and in here i'm just going to use a


576
09:03:12,400 --> 09:03:15,360
pixel to switch so i'm just going to say add in here


577
09:03:15,360 --> 09:03:20,000
okay and it says one tester has been added to this group and that's pretty


578
09:03:20,000 --> 09:03:23,440
much it so i don't have to do anything extra there


579
09:03:23,440 --> 09:03:29,592
so what i'm gonna do then is going to wait for um an email to be sent by app


580
09:03:29,592 --> 09:03:33,512
store connect to my user and it's just been sent i'm gonna open it so you can


581
09:03:33,512 --> 09:03:37,192
also see it how it looks like here's the email that i just received so app store


582
09:03:37,192 --> 09:03:41,592
connect is telling me that hey you've now been invited to and test this


583
09:03:41,592 --> 09:03:45,592
application and you can just go ahead and do it so i'm just gonna tap on view


584
09:03:45,592 --> 09:03:50,552
in test flight and this is just gonna work because i already have um


585
09:03:50,552 --> 09:03:55,760
basically a test light installed on my macintosh so let me just tap on that and


586
09:03:55,760 --> 09:03:59,360
i can see test flight open on a separate screen i'll bring it to the screen here


587
09:03:59,360 --> 09:04:04,680
and i can accept in basically installing


588
09:04:05,440 --> 09:04:09,832
this application so as the bottom as the bottom captioning indicates we've


589
09:04:09,832 --> 09:04:14,080
already looked at the email it looked like this and now we're going


590
09:04:14,080 --> 09:04:18,400
to install this application which is a flutter application


591
09:04:18,400 --> 09:04:22,232
but we're installing it on a macintosh and that's just great so let's just


592
09:04:22,232 --> 09:04:26,872
accept this and you can see now i can either say install or done so i'm just


593
09:04:26,872 --> 09:04:30,480
gonna say done so you see it so this is our application here and i'm just gonna


594
09:04:30,480 --> 09:04:34,800
press the install button and this is just gonna go to app store connect and


595
09:04:34,800 --> 09:04:41,592
grab that binary and bring it down so and i can just press the open button


596
09:04:41,592 --> 09:04:47,120
and if everything goes well this is our flutter application running on this


597
09:04:47,120 --> 09:04:51,272
macintosh but it is an ios app we didn't actually


598
09:04:51,272 --> 09:04:54,640
compile this to be running on a macintosh so everything is just working


599
09:04:54,640 --> 09:04:58,480
as it should i can even log in here


600
09:04:58,832 --> 09:05:04,080
right like that and then in here it's a foo bar bass


601
09:05:04,080 --> 09:05:08,000
log in and i can see my note so it's working as


602
09:05:08,000 --> 09:05:12,080
expected so i'm just going to close the app now all right


603
09:05:12,080 --> 09:05:15,360
so what we need to do now is to submit this


604
09:05:15,360 --> 09:05:18,720
build we've looked at it it seems to be working fine so i'm just going to close


605
09:05:18,720 --> 09:05:22,552
test flight here and close this email let's then go to app store connect and


606
09:05:22,552 --> 09:05:27,440
let's go to this app store section in here and in this ios app section here


607
09:05:27,440 --> 09:05:32,400
1.0 prepare for submission let's scroll down to the place that says build and we


608
09:05:32,400 --> 09:05:36,720
need to then say select a build before you submit your app okay now


609
09:05:36,720 --> 09:05:40,232
remember uh if you don't see this blue button in


610
09:05:40,232 --> 09:05:45,120
here that's because you've probably just submitted your bill to apple


611
09:05:45,120 --> 09:05:49,192
apple usually takes up to 30 minutes or sometimes even more to validate your


612
09:05:49,192 --> 09:05:53,440
build so they may not have even appeared in here especially if it's the first


613
09:05:53,440 --> 09:05:56,800
build that you're sending to apple it may take a while for


614
09:05:56,800 --> 09:06:01,592
them to process it so you may not see this button simply because there is no


615
09:06:01,592 --> 09:06:06,320
valid build yet but you can test you can check the status of your builds by just


616
09:06:06,320 --> 09:06:10,160
going to this test flight section and just having a look at the version that


617
09:06:10,160 --> 09:06:15,120
you've submitted and if there is if that build is still processing it will just


618
09:06:15,120 --> 09:06:19,512
say uh paranthesis processing and the icon will just be a little bit grayed


619
09:06:19,512 --> 09:06:23,120
out okay so don't worry it's not there's nothing wrong you just have to wait a


620
09:06:23,120 --> 09:06:26,232
little bit so in here i'm just going to say select


621
09:06:26,232 --> 09:06:29,592
a bill before you submit your app and then say one that build that i'd


622
09:06:29,592 --> 09:06:35,592
submitted all right so and then i'm just gonna press the save button


623
09:06:35,592 --> 09:06:40,480
so that's for the build so age rating in app store connect


624
09:06:40,480 --> 09:06:44,232
go to app information and fill in age rating and i believe we've already done


625
09:06:44,232 --> 09:06:48,232
this so if if you've not done that before please go ahead and take care of


626
09:06:48,232 --> 09:06:51,912
that but i explained this in one of the previous chapters so you may have to go


627
09:06:51,912 --> 09:06:56,400
and edit your age rating if you want to but if you have followed the chapters


628
09:06:56,400 --> 09:06:58,640
chronologically you should have done this


629
09:06:58,640 --> 09:07:02,800
by this point okay


630
09:07:02,800 --> 09:07:06,960
we also need to take care of our app privacy so we need to go to app privacy


631
09:07:06,960 --> 09:07:10,000
as the caption at the bottom of the screen indicates and here we have to get


632
09:07:10,000 --> 09:07:12,640
started by filling out


633
09:07:12,640 --> 09:07:16,720
our app privacy and as you can see in here if you have an


634
09:07:16,720 --> 09:07:20,800
application that collects a lot of data you i don't want to scare you but you


635
09:07:20,800 --> 09:07:25,760
may kind of be in trouble because you will have to inform apple about all


636
09:07:25,760 --> 09:07:29,272
those things what you're collecting from the user okay


637
09:07:29,272 --> 09:07:34,720
so let's let's in here let's say do you or third party partners collect data


638
09:07:34,720 --> 09:07:38,232
from this app then we should say yes in here right because we are collecting


639
09:07:38,232 --> 09:07:43,440
data and that is the user's for instance email address


640
09:07:43,440 --> 09:07:49,592
password and notes so let's just say yes in here's a data types that meet all of


641
09:07:49,592 --> 09:07:53,832
the following criteria are optional to disclosure the data is not used for


642
09:07:53,832 --> 09:07:56,552
tracking we're not using it for tracking the data


643
09:07:56,552 --> 09:08:00,480
is not used for third party we're not doing that collection of data occurs


644
09:08:00,480 --> 09:08:04,480
only in infrequent cases okay so we pretty much are not


645
09:08:04,480 --> 09:08:08,480
doing any of those tracking stuff that they're saying here so


646
09:08:08,480 --> 09:08:11,832
let's go in here and say data collection yeah we're collecting your email address


647
09:08:11,832 --> 09:08:14,232
and that's it


648
09:08:14,232 --> 09:08:18,640
we're not collecting any financial information location


649
09:08:18,640 --> 09:08:24,232
contacts user content photos audio gameplay none of that


650
09:08:24,232 --> 09:08:30,552
any other user generated contents yes browsing history no search history no


651
09:08:30,552 --> 09:08:35,360
user ids screen name handle account id


652
09:08:35,360 --> 09:08:39,040
yes we are device id we're not


653
09:08:39,040 --> 09:08:42,480
um diagnosis crash data we're not doing


654
09:08:42,480 --> 09:08:46,080
that at the moment and other data so yeah this seems fine


655
09:08:46,080 --> 09:08:50,320
so for now we can just say identifier to user id we also said other user content


656
09:08:50,320 --> 09:08:54,000
because we're collecting the users generated notes and we're also


657
09:08:54,000 --> 09:08:57,592
collecting their email address so let's just say saving here


658
09:08:57,592 --> 09:09:02,232
okay and it says additional setup required so let's go ahead and fix those


659
09:09:02,232 --> 09:09:05,512
now in email address let's go set up email address so i'm going to click


660
09:09:05,512 --> 09:09:08,720
there and are we using it for third party no


661
09:09:08,720 --> 09:09:14,232
developer advertising no analytics no product personalization


662
09:09:14,232 --> 09:09:19,592
customizing what the user sees such as a list of recommended products for no


663
09:09:19,592 --> 09:09:24,080
app functionality yes that's what we're doing so press next


664
09:09:24,080 --> 09:09:27,360
and are the email addresses collected from this app linked to the user's


665
09:09:27,360 --> 09:09:32,320
identity link to the yes email address collector


666
09:09:32,320 --> 09:09:36,552
link to the user's identity are there i mean this is this is a


667
09:09:36,552 --> 09:09:39,440
little bit of a legal question so i'm not best


668
09:09:39,440 --> 09:09:42,480
um placed here to


669
09:09:42,480 --> 09:09:47,120
answer this but i mean an email isn't necessarily connected to someone's


670
09:09:47,120 --> 09:09:51,272
identity as a person because i can just go create like a private email and no


671
09:09:51,272 --> 09:09:54,800
one knows about so i'm just gonna answer no


672
09:09:54,800 --> 09:09:59,360
tracking email address okay next


673
09:09:59,360 --> 09:10:02,400
um okay


674
09:10:02,400 --> 09:10:05,912
doesn't seem like okay do you or third-party partners use email addresses


675
09:10:05,912 --> 09:10:11,680
for tracking purposes nope okay and saved okay so


676
09:10:11,680 --> 09:10:15,760
the email address stuff is saved now let's go to other user content which is


677
09:10:15,760 --> 09:10:20,552
the user generated notes okay so indicate how other user content


678
09:10:20,552 --> 09:10:25,512
collected from this app is being used um advertising no analytics no


679
09:10:25,512 --> 09:10:29,272
customization no and app functionality of course


680
09:10:29,272 --> 09:10:32,872
so let's then go and say is user content collected from the sub link to the


681
09:10:32,872 --> 09:10:36,800
user's identity they're used they're linked to the


682
09:10:36,800 --> 09:10:40,960
user's email and since we said email is not linked to the user's identity i'm


683
09:10:40,960 --> 09:10:46,400
just gonna reason to say no in here do you or third-party partners use other


684
09:10:46,400 --> 09:10:52,720
user content for tracking purposes nope okay so that part is done as well then


685
09:10:52,720 --> 09:10:56,320
let's go to identifiers for user id so i'm just going to click there


686
09:10:56,320 --> 09:11:02,000
and remember user id in here is that uid that firebase creates okay remember that


687
09:11:02,000 --> 09:11:06,080
so we're using that for app functionality okay


688
09:11:06,080 --> 09:11:10,872
are the user ids collected from this app linked to the user's identity


689
09:11:10,872 --> 09:11:15,040
user id user identity


690
09:11:15,040 --> 09:11:19,360
i would say yes it is quite obvious so let's just say yes


691
09:11:19,360 --> 09:11:24,960
do you or third party partners use user ids for tracking purposes nope


692
09:11:24,960 --> 09:11:28,640
nope all right so saved and that's that now


693
09:11:28,640 --> 09:11:32,552
you've gone through the privacy policy and this is like that


694
09:11:32,552 --> 09:11:35,832
basically what happens is apple will


695
09:11:35,832 --> 09:11:41,272
display this to users when they try to download your application this is very


696
09:11:41,272 --> 09:11:45,592
important that you fill in to the best of your knowledge and ability this is


697
09:11:45,592 --> 09:11:50,160
not the place that you go and fake anything and say try to hide the


698
09:11:50,160 --> 09:11:54,080
information that you're collecting from the users it is in the in your best


699
09:11:54,080 --> 09:11:58,552
interest in your product's best interest and in your company's best interest to


700
09:11:58,552 --> 09:12:05,040
make sure that you fill these in as best as you can okay usually in bigger


701
09:12:05,040 --> 09:12:10,080
companies you'd want to probably um consult with a lawyer or somebody who's


702
09:12:10,080 --> 09:12:14,552
um good at making sure you're not missing anything so in a big company you


703
09:12:14,552 --> 09:12:18,320
usually don't do this on your own but since we're now assuming that you're a


704
09:12:18,320 --> 09:12:22,320
simple like a single entity even if you're behind an organization like me


705
09:12:22,320 --> 09:12:28,480
but you're a single entity and trying to do this to the best of your ability okay


706
09:12:28,480 --> 09:12:33,040
so now what we need to do is also fill in this um


707
09:12:33,040 --> 09:12:38,720
let's see here privacy policy so what this is as you can see in here a


708
09:12:38,720 --> 09:12:43,120
url that links to the privacy policy privacy policy is required for all apps


709
09:12:43,120 --> 09:12:46,400
and as you can see at the bottom of the screen i've actually included a little


710
09:12:46,400 --> 09:12:52,480
privacy policy for my own website and i've included that let's see


711
09:12:52,480 --> 09:12:57,272
if i can log in in here let's see if i can do it on a separate


712
09:12:57,272 --> 09:13:01,360
window so you don't have to be bothered by that


713
09:13:03,760 --> 09:13:10,320
because i've actually included that um you know what i will actually do it on a


714
09:13:10,320 --> 09:13:16,000
separate screen so you don't have to be bothered by that and um


715
09:13:16,232 --> 09:13:20,480
so i will go to


716
09:13:21,512 --> 09:13:24,872
i'll go to my hosting website and i'll take care of that and then i'll bring it


717
09:13:24,872 --> 09:13:29,272
to the screen so you can actually see it so


718
09:13:29,272 --> 09:13:34,720
let's see if i can go to my hosting in here and then go to my


719
09:13:35,192 --> 09:13:39,120
hosting basically


720
09:13:39,120 --> 09:13:43,912
well all my file files are residing excuse me


721
09:13:43,912 --> 09:13:48,400
and i'll bring it in here so let's have a look at this url that i provided at


722
09:13:48,400 --> 09:13:51,512
the bottom of the screen you can see pixel dsc privacy policy so i'm going to


723
09:13:51,512 --> 09:13:54,480
go to dub dub up there and i have a look at


724
09:13:54,480 --> 09:13:58,872
this text file which is right there privacy policy so if i type pixelity


725
09:13:58,872 --> 09:14:04,160
excuse me privacy policy you see that there is a generic privacy policy that


726
09:14:04,160 --> 09:14:08,160
i've placed in my website and you will need to do the same thing


727
09:14:08,160 --> 09:14:12,480
so you'll need to basically grab a privacy policy from somewhere and look


728
09:14:12,480 --> 09:14:17,120
at that privacy policy and make sure that it works for you so what i did is i


729
09:14:17,120 --> 09:14:20,480
found a website and i'm not just going to go advertising


730
09:14:20,480 --> 09:14:25,912
here but you can find free privacy policy written by a very good and smart


731
09:14:25,912 --> 09:14:30,320
people and you can have a look at those adjust them to make sure that they make


732
09:14:30,320 --> 09:14:34,080
sense for you and your company and for instance in here i've just taken a


733
09:14:34,080 --> 09:14:38,872
generic privacy policy let's see if i can find it here


734
09:14:38,872 --> 09:14:43,120
so i put my company name in there and i just ensure that it makes sense for my


735
09:14:43,120 --> 09:14:47,192
company and i've just basically put it inside that url that you can see at the


736
09:14:47,192 --> 09:14:50,872
bottom of the screen so i'm going to go in here at privacy and app store connect


737
09:14:50,872 --> 09:14:54,800
and say privacy policy edit and in the privacy policy url i'm just going to say


738
09:14:54,800 --> 09:14:59,360
https pixelity dot se and then i'm just going to say


739
09:14:59,360 --> 09:15:03,680
privacy policy.txt but for you this should be


740
09:15:03,680 --> 09:15:07,680
something else okay and i'm just going to copy that open it and make sure that


741
09:15:07,680 --> 09:15:12,232
it exists and then i'm going to press the save button okay


742
09:15:12,232 --> 09:15:17,912
so after we've done that we also need to make sure that we've taken care of our


743
09:15:17,912 --> 09:15:22,800
categories the categories to which our application belongs so let's go to app


744
09:15:22,800 --> 09:15:26,000
information at the bottom of the screen indicates i'm going here in the category


745
09:15:26,000 --> 09:15:30,000
and the primary category we're going to say our app belongs to productivity and


746
09:15:30,000 --> 09:15:36,232
then it belongs to utilities okay here utilities all right then i'm gonna


747
09:15:36,232 --> 09:15:39,272
save this information


748
09:15:39,360 --> 09:15:44,080
okay then what we need to also do before we submit our app for review is that


749
09:15:44,080 --> 09:15:50,000
just remember this application is going to be reviewed by an actual human so


750
09:15:50,000 --> 09:15:54,320
this person is literally going to get this information in the queue of their


751
09:15:54,320 --> 09:15:57,360
work they're going to say oh an application called my awesome notes


752
09:15:57,360 --> 09:16:00,640
needs to be reviewed and then they're going to say okay


753
09:16:00,640 --> 09:16:03,192
they're going to have some control panel on their screen i don't know really how


754
09:16:03,192 --> 09:16:07,680
it's formed on apple's site but they're going to then download this application


755
09:16:07,680 --> 09:16:12,080
on various devices automatically perhaps and then they're gonna open the app and


756
09:16:12,080 --> 09:16:15,192
then like how am i supposed to use this app so


757
09:16:15,192 --> 09:16:19,360
it is in your best interest to ensure that you provide all information


758
09:16:19,360 --> 09:16:24,232
possible to that person so that they can review your application so what you need


759
09:16:24,232 --> 09:16:28,960
to do then is to go inside app here prepare for submission in here app


760
09:16:28,960 --> 09:16:33,680
review information and then under notes just tell that person


761
09:16:33,680 --> 09:16:38,160
what your how your application works and how they need to register so in here


762
09:16:38,160 --> 09:16:42,400
what we're going to say is um you you will need


763
09:16:42,400 --> 09:16:46,160
a valid email address in order


764
09:16:46,160 --> 09:16:49,120
to register please follow these


765
09:16:49,120 --> 09:16:55,592
steps to register now i'm gonna say um open the register view and register


766
09:16:55,592 --> 09:17:02,000
with the email and password of your choosing


767
09:17:02,000 --> 09:17:09,192
you're choosing wait for a confirmation email


768
09:17:09,192 --> 09:17:16,480
wait for a confirmation email from to be to be sent to your email address


769
09:17:16,480 --> 09:17:20,000
and in the confirmation


770
09:17:20,320 --> 09:17:24,480
click on the link to confirm your email


771
09:17:24,480 --> 09:17:29,360
address okay and then step three is go back


772
09:17:29,360 --> 09:17:34,832
to the app and in the login screen log


773
09:17:34,832 --> 09:17:40,720
in with your email and password


774
09:17:40,720 --> 09:17:44,800
and that's it so we've done that now so i'm gonna


775
09:17:44,800 --> 09:17:48,232
actually then provide a valid phone number in here and since i don't want to


776
09:17:48,232 --> 09:17:52,160
really share my like phone number everywhere on the internet i'm just


777
09:17:52,160 --> 09:17:55,680
going to go on to a separate screen here and


778
09:17:55,680 --> 09:18:00,640
write my valid phone number in here um


779
09:18:00,640 --> 09:18:05,512
but that's my phone number great and let's then


780
09:18:05,512 --> 09:18:08,872
go here and then i'm going to press save button as well


781
09:18:08,872 --> 09:18:13,192
and then bring the screen here perfect so now i've saved that information


782
09:18:13,192 --> 09:18:17,512
including my phone number and everything should be ready at this point


783
09:18:17,512 --> 09:18:22,160
so what you need to do then is to go and grab some popcorn while you're


784
09:18:22,160 --> 09:18:26,552
doing this hopefully and then you'll just need to say submit for review


785
09:18:26,552 --> 09:18:29,592
and it says the items below need to be okay


786
09:18:29,592 --> 09:18:33,832
we haven't really done the price pricing and then it saw it says an admin must


787
09:18:33,832 --> 09:18:37,832
provide information about the app's privacy practices in app privacy section


788
09:18:37,832 --> 09:18:42,080
it seems like we missed some stuff so let's go to pricing and availability and


789
09:18:42,080 --> 09:18:45,760
fix that this application is going to be free so i'm just going to say it doesn't


790
09:18:45,760 --> 09:18:49,040
cost anything and save that so that's for pricing


791
09:18:49,040 --> 09:18:52,720
and let's go to app privacy and see if we've actually missed anything doesn't


792
09:18:52,720 --> 09:18:56,400
seem like it but what we've forgotten is to actually press the publish button so


793
09:18:56,400 --> 09:19:00,960
let's just publish that okay then we go back in here and then we


794
09:19:00,960 --> 09:19:03,592
say submit


795
09:19:03,832 --> 09:19:09,912
that's great so now your application is submitted to app store and a reviewer


796
09:19:09,912 --> 09:19:13,760
from the app store connecting is going to have a look at your application so


797
09:19:13,760 --> 09:19:18,232
that they can confirm that it works according to the


798
09:19:18,232 --> 09:19:22,080
information that you've provided and i can see that i actually got an email


799
09:19:22,080 --> 09:19:26,480
from apple that looks like this and it says the status of your application has


800
09:19:26,480 --> 09:19:30,232
changed to waiting for review so it's not a waiting game so


801
09:19:30,232 --> 09:19:34,552
um but before before we actually do all of this we


802
09:19:34,552 --> 09:19:39,272
whether apple has had the time to review our application and


803
09:19:39,272 --> 09:19:42,720
accept it or they found some bugs in it and


804
09:19:42,720 --> 09:19:48,320
rejected our application whichever case we need to draw back this


805
09:19:48,320 --> 09:19:52,160
build and i will show you how in the upcoming chapters because we have the


806
09:19:52,160 --> 09:19:56,720
security bug that i told you about so for now we can just be happy that we've


807
09:19:56,720 --> 09:19:59,440
gone through this chapter we've done quite a lot of work


808
09:19:59,440 --> 09:20:04,160
and um pat yourself on the back just great job


809
09:20:04,160 --> 09:20:08,872
and grab some uh maybe a tea or coffee


810
09:20:08,872 --> 09:20:12,960
and we can get start to actually get ready for the next chapter and i'll tell


811
09:20:12,960 --> 09:20:16,960
you actually what we need to talk about in the next chapter and that is this


812
09:20:16,960 --> 09:20:21,680
little um problem that we had in the all notes and


813
09:20:21,680 --> 09:20:26,800
we need to fix this before we can go live with android as well so


814
09:20:26,800 --> 09:20:30,872
now you know what's coming in the upcoming chapters and um


815
09:20:30,872 --> 09:20:34,640
i'll see you there hello everyone and welcome to chapter 49 of this flutter


816
09:20:34,640 --> 09:20:40,000
course in previous chapters we've submitted our application to um


817
09:20:40,000 --> 09:20:43,760
app store connect and we also briefly talked about the fact


818
09:20:43,760 --> 09:20:47,912
that we have a little bit of a security problem in our firebase firestore


819
09:20:47,912 --> 09:20:51,760
database so let's have a look at what the actual


820
09:20:51,760 --> 09:20:55,680
problem is so i explained this briefly in the previous chapters but i'll do it


821
09:20:55,680 --> 09:21:00,160
again in here so let's have a look um so if this is our code i'm going to


822
09:21:00,160 --> 09:21:04,720
increase the size so we'll see it better and you'll see that when we are working


823
09:21:04,720 --> 09:21:09,192
with displaying all the notes on the screen for a user so for instance user a


824
09:21:09,192 --> 09:21:13,272
has signed into the application and inside our


825
09:21:13,272 --> 09:21:16,480
notes view if you go there we'll see that we're


826
09:21:16,480 --> 09:21:20,720
subscribing to all nodes in here in our stream builder so we're saying we're


827
09:21:20,720 --> 09:21:25,680
basically building our entire list view which is here now it's list view and


828
09:21:25,680 --> 09:21:30,232
we're building it on top of the data that comes from this all nodes function


829
09:21:30,232 --> 09:21:34,800
which is at the moment inside our firebase cloud storage okay


830
09:21:34,800 --> 09:21:39,120
however if you look at this code you'll see that what it is doing is referring


831
09:21:39,120 --> 09:21:44,400
to this node's private um or this node's local variable and which


832
09:21:44,400 --> 09:21:48,080
is right here and this notes at the moment is


833
09:21:48,080 --> 09:21:54,080
pointing to the notes collection and what it does it literally takes all


834
09:21:54,080 --> 09:21:59,912
the notes from the notes collection so this look this essentially means any


835
09:21:59,912 --> 09:22:04,720
user logged into our application is truly retrieving all the nodes in the


836
09:22:04,720 --> 09:22:07,360
entire database although


837
09:22:07,360 --> 09:22:11,760
at the end of that code what we're doing is saying we're okay after we retrieve


838
09:22:11,760 --> 09:22:16,552
all the nodes from the database then we're mapping them here to cloud


839
09:22:16,552 --> 09:22:20,232
nodes so we can consume them locally and


840
09:22:20,232 --> 09:22:25,120
right at the end we're saying hey but we're only interested in notes that are


841
09:22:25,120 --> 09:22:27,680
for discard user but


842
09:22:27,680 --> 09:22:31,040
even though the current login user is not going to see all the notes in the


843
09:22:31,040 --> 09:22:36,640
database but the current user is reading all the notes in the database and if you


844
09:22:36,640 --> 09:22:40,720
perform a man in the middle attack for instance if you're using charles proxy


845
09:22:40,720 --> 09:22:45,832
on a computer and then you're using your phone and you're using for


846
09:22:45,832 --> 09:22:49,272
instance let's say you have charles proxy on your computer and then you're


847
09:22:49,272 --> 09:22:53,592
sharing your wi-fi connection from an ethernet connection through wi-fi with


848
09:22:53,592 --> 09:22:57,120
an iphone that is running your application if i don't sit in the middle


849
09:22:57,120 --> 09:23:00,232
with charles proxy and look at all the traffic that's going from your flutter


850
09:23:00,232 --> 09:23:05,040
application to firebase then i can actually see you requesting information


851
09:23:05,040 --> 09:23:09,912
about all those notes and then those notes coming back to the application so


852
09:23:09,912 --> 09:23:15,040
a man in the middle attack could potentially then expose all data in our


853
09:23:15,040 --> 09:23:18,640
database or in the notes collection at least so we need to


854
09:23:18,640 --> 09:23:23,512
we need to fix this so what we're going to do is by is to start


855
09:23:23,512 --> 09:23:28,552
by removing our application from app store connect if you remember in the


856
09:23:28,552 --> 09:23:33,192
previous chapters we sent our application to apple for review and what


857
09:23:33,192 --> 09:23:38,000
i've done in here i've developer rejected this application essentially so


858
09:23:38,000 --> 09:23:42,400
let me have a look and see if i can increase the size of the screen so we


859
09:23:42,400 --> 09:23:46,800
submitted our application to app store connect for review from the apple um


860
09:23:46,800 --> 09:23:51,272
team review team but right before it actually went to review i refreshed the


861
09:23:51,272 --> 09:23:55,360
screen in here and you didn't see this but i said remove this application from


862
09:23:55,360 --> 09:23:59,592
review if you remove your own application from review basically it


863
09:23:59,592 --> 09:24:04,552
will become this it will go to the state developer rejected so this is basically


864
09:24:04,552 --> 09:24:08,480
informing you that hey it's not apple basically rejecting your application it


865
09:24:08,480 --> 09:24:13,760
is you yourself who's done this so so i can show you an example how


866
09:24:13,760 --> 09:24:16,480
that confirmation email from apple will look


867
09:24:16,480 --> 09:24:20,232
like so i'll open it in a separate screen


868
09:24:20,232 --> 09:24:24,400
and it kind of looks like this i'll bring it to this main screen so you see


869
09:24:24,400 --> 09:24:26,720
it as well okay all right


870
09:24:26,720 --> 09:24:30,960
so there we go so then i received an email from apple that said that status


871
09:24:30,960 --> 09:24:36,400
of your app has changed to developer rejected app name blah blah okay so


872
09:24:36,400 --> 09:24:39,912
this is the email that you'll receive so i need you to basically reject your


873
09:24:39,912 --> 09:24:43,192
application the version one zero that you sent to


874
09:24:43,192 --> 09:24:47,040
apple because we have security problems with that application okay and again


875
09:24:47,040 --> 09:24:50,640
i've mentioned this in the previous chapters i did this in on purpose so


876
09:24:50,640 --> 09:24:53,680
that we can understand like someone because this is the kind of stuff that


877
09:24:53,680 --> 09:24:56,232
you're going to go through as a software developer sometimes you're going to


878
09:24:56,232 --> 09:25:00,872
submit something to apple or google and then you understand you made a mistake


879
09:25:00,872 --> 09:25:05,192
so how do you how do you fix that and i really wanted this to be a part of this


880
09:25:05,192 --> 09:25:09,360
um course so you understand how you reject


881
09:25:09,360 --> 09:25:12,320
your application how you fix the problem and how you resubmit the application


882
09:25:12,320 --> 09:25:16,552
okay but i didn't want to do it for both ios and android because it just gets


883
09:25:16,552 --> 09:25:20,000
boring if you have to submit first go through the entire submission from two


884
09:25:20,000 --> 09:25:23,592
platforms and then to submit again so that's why we first submitted for ios


885
09:25:23,592 --> 09:25:26,640
and then we're gonna fix it and then once that's fixed we're also gonna


886
09:25:26,640 --> 09:25:31,120
submit for android okay so after rejecting your application you


887
09:25:31,120 --> 09:25:36,400
also need to basically remove your build from this at 1.0 so i i believe i've


888
09:25:36,400 --> 09:25:39,760
already done that oh no i haven't so it's actually good i haven't done that


889
09:25:39,760 --> 09:25:44,400
so let's go ahead and here in 1.0 and just remove this build okay so we say we


890
09:25:44,400 --> 09:25:48,720
don't want to submit anything and then press save okay


891
09:25:49,832 --> 09:25:53,912
all right um and also as you can see at the bottom of the screen we're going to


892
09:25:53,912 --> 09:25:59,760
update this 1.0 version now to 1.1 so let's go and see if he can find that


893
09:25:59,760 --> 09:26:04,232
information so right now i also saw that i got an email from


894
09:26:04,232 --> 09:26:07,912
apple and here says okay now it's prepared for submission meaning that


895
09:26:07,912 --> 09:26:12,480
it's not developed or rejected anymore and let's just bump this version in here


896
09:26:12,480 --> 09:26:17,760
to 1.1 0.0 okay and then i'm going to save it


897
09:26:17,760 --> 09:26:22,232
well and here i mean this is kind of like a it depends on your taste if you


898
09:26:22,232 --> 09:26:27,192
want to resubmit 1.0 you're more than welcome to do that but it's usually


899
09:26:27,192 --> 09:26:32,640
if you change something in your code then it is usual for you to go and


900
09:26:32,640 --> 09:26:36,552
update this um minor version and it's called so because


901
09:26:36,552 --> 09:26:39,832
this first version is the major version so if there's a huge future in the


902
09:26:39,832 --> 09:26:44,400
application and this is the minor version and here is a patch i mean


903
09:26:44,400 --> 09:26:48,320
you could argue that we could i essentially maybe change our application


904
09:26:48,320 --> 09:26:53,832
version to one zero one because this is a patch but i just choose to do one one


905
09:26:53,832 --> 09:26:58,000
zero okay so let's go ahead and i'm assuming that


906
09:26:58,000 --> 09:27:00,160
you're doing the same thing because there's some information i'm gonna


907
09:27:00,160 --> 09:27:03,832
provide to you a little bit later in this chapter that relies on you having


908
09:27:03,832 --> 09:27:07,592
actually changed your app version to one one zero okay


909
09:27:07,592 --> 09:27:12,000
so that's that part is done what we need to do now is to go as a caption in case


910
09:27:12,000 --> 09:27:16,400
we're gonna go clean all the notes and users in our firestore


911
09:27:16,400 --> 09:27:21,680
database so let's go ahead and see if we can get that to work so


912
09:27:21,680 --> 09:27:24,640
my notes flutter project so that's in your


913
09:27:24,640 --> 09:27:29,192
firebase console and i'm going to go first to authentication to users there's


914
09:27:29,192 --> 09:27:32,720
just one user in here i'm just going to delete that account okay then i'm going


915
09:27:32,720 --> 09:27:36,720
to go to firestore database and there's probably two notes in the notes


916
09:27:36,720 --> 09:27:41,360
collection and i'm going to delete them as well so delete documents there and


917
09:27:41,360 --> 09:27:45,832
then delete this document as well okay so we have a clean slate no users and no


918
09:27:45,832 --> 09:27:51,192
notes in the database so you may be wondering well if we have


919
09:27:51,192 --> 09:27:54,800
security problems with our database shouldn't firebase be intelligent enough


920
09:27:54,800 --> 09:27:58,400
to know that and firebase is actually intelligent enough to know that and


921
09:27:58,400 --> 09:28:02,480
sometimes you will receive emails from i mean depending on the security holes in


922
09:28:02,480 --> 09:28:06,720
your database you will receive emails from at firebase telling you that hey


923
09:28:06,720 --> 09:28:10,552
there is something wrong with your security rules and i've prepared some


924
09:28:10,552 --> 09:28:14,640
email that that kind of indicates that i just wanted to show you how that kind of


925
09:28:14,640 --> 09:28:17,912
email looks like so you can see if you have security


926
09:28:17,912 --> 09:28:21,832
issues with your fire firebase and firestore database you may receive


927
09:28:21,832 --> 09:28:24,552
something like this you see it says we've detected the following issues with


928
09:28:24,552 --> 09:28:28,720
your security rules any user can read your entire database so


929
09:28:28,720 --> 09:28:33,192
it kind of looks like this okay so just know that if you receive an email like


930
09:28:33,192 --> 09:28:37,272
that then you know at least the reason for it okay


931
09:28:37,272 --> 09:28:41,912
and if you're wondering more about like security rules and


932
09:28:41,912 --> 09:28:44,720
how you have to configure them although i'm going to tell you how we're going to


933
09:28:44,720 --> 09:28:47,512
configure our security rules in this chapter but if you're wondering how to


934
09:28:47,512 --> 09:28:51,360
do that on your own and you're curious about reading more about it i've


935
09:28:51,360 --> 09:28:55,760
prepared a little link here so let me see if i can actually bring it


936
09:28:55,760 --> 09:28:59,760
to the screen by opening


937
09:28:59,760 --> 09:29:03,440
a link and it kind of looks like this so you see firebase google.com docs first


938
09:29:03,440 --> 09:29:06,640
our security rules and conditions so


939
09:29:06,640 --> 09:29:11,040
and so you can read about this and i did that and i got a lot of inspiration from


940
09:29:11,040 --> 09:29:15,360
how to fix our security uh problem in our


941
09:29:15,360 --> 09:29:18,400
firestore database so i strongly suggest that you actually read this


942
09:29:18,400 --> 09:29:22,872
documentation you don't have to do it right now but please just at least um


943
09:29:22,872 --> 09:29:27,360
bookmark this page so you can come back to it later


944
09:29:27,360 --> 09:29:32,720
okay so now to the point let's go and fix our security issue in our firestore


945
09:29:32,720 --> 09:29:37,272
database okay so i've also prepared here how we have to actually do it and you


946
09:29:37,272 --> 09:29:41,760
can see the let me actually bring up our security rules so go to firestore


947
09:29:41,760 --> 09:29:46,552
database tab in your firebase console and then go to rules okay let's have a


948
09:29:46,552 --> 09:29:50,320
look at all roles at the moment and how they're set up so the way it's set up at


949
09:29:50,320 --> 09:29:54,320
the moment you can see it says match any database and any documents okay and


950
09:29:54,320 --> 09:29:58,720
that's what we're doing here as well and it says match any document in there so


951
09:29:58,720 --> 09:30:02,320
at the moment we're allowing read and write access only if you're


952
09:30:02,320 --> 09:30:08,960
authenticated so okay so let's just for now say we are allowing create


953
09:30:08,960 --> 09:30:13,832
if you're authenticated so we say you should be able to create a node as long


954
09:30:13,832 --> 09:30:17,120
as you're authenticated so let's say create and you can see we get some help


955
09:30:17,120 --> 09:30:21,760
from firebase as well in here okay so that's that so creation and then we


956
09:30:21,760 --> 09:30:27,360
say allow read write and update


957
09:30:27,360 --> 09:30:30,400
okay and this is the rules that we're going to write in here you can see read


958
09:30:30,400 --> 09:30:34,800
update actually read update and delete so


959
09:30:34,800 --> 09:30:40,160
so read updates and delete and the way we have to set it up is of course as you


960
09:30:40,160 --> 09:30:44,960
can see in here what i preferred is we first need to make sure anyone tries to


961
09:30:44,960 --> 09:30:49,192
read from our database or update the database or delete the document should


962
09:30:49,192 --> 09:30:53,040
be authenticated so let's go in here and say okay if


963
09:30:53,040 --> 09:30:56,800
authenticated we'll bring that code up here okay


964
09:30:56,800 --> 09:31:01,192
but we're also going to add some more information to it and the information


965
09:31:01,192 --> 09:31:05,832
should like look like this you can see in this document in here


966
09:31:05,832 --> 09:31:11,760
you may be like okay but how do i know because okay before i actually say that


967
09:31:11,760 --> 09:31:16,872
what we want is for the currently authenticated user id


968
09:31:16,872 --> 09:31:23,360
to only be able to access his or her documents that have the same user id


969
09:31:23,360 --> 09:31:28,552
remember in our code we have this user id field let me bring it up here


970
09:31:28,552 --> 09:31:33,192
so if you go to our storage here we have these constants and we have this user id


971
09:31:33,192 --> 09:31:39,272
field so every node that we store in our firestore database has a user id field


972
09:31:39,272 --> 09:31:45,592
so what we want in here is to basically grab the user id from the request so if


973
09:31:45,592 --> 09:31:50,480
you say in here request you'll see we have off path resource so let's go off


974
09:31:50,480 --> 09:31:54,552
and then you'll see there's something called a uid and that is the user id


975
09:31:54,552 --> 09:31:59,192
okay so if we have a look how we have to actually do that so we're saying user


976
09:31:59,192 --> 09:32:04,552
request rtu id should be equal to resource data user id and this resource


977
09:32:04,552 --> 09:32:09,360
is the current resource that the user is trying to access okay and if you read


978
09:32:09,360 --> 09:32:13,120
the documentation that i provided to you earlier you'll you would know this so


979
09:32:13,120 --> 09:32:17,120
let's go in here and say okay the request auth uid should be equal to


980
09:32:17,120 --> 09:32:21,120
resource beta dot user id because that's the


981
09:32:21,120 --> 09:32:27,912
field that we provided um as you saw in the code here so let's then um


982
09:32:27,912 --> 09:32:31,760
yeah i think this is good to go so we could then publish these changes and it


983
09:32:31,760 --> 09:32:34,960
says publish changes can take up to a minute to propagate and that's


984
09:32:34,960 --> 09:32:38,640
completely fine because we're actually going to take some time in order to


985
09:32:38,640 --> 09:32:43,192
update our code as well okay so that's our


986
09:32:43,192 --> 09:32:46,800
security rule so let's just make sure that they look like this and i'm gonna


987
09:32:46,800 --> 09:32:50,872
actually bring it to two lines so you can see it in its entirety


988
09:32:50,872 --> 09:32:55,912
um if you need to get some um inspiration from this you can also build


989
09:32:55,912 --> 09:32:59,512
on top of this tomorrow so you can add more security to this so you're more


990
09:32:59,512 --> 09:33:03,040
welcome to um


991
09:33:03,040 --> 09:33:07,360
then what we need to do is start cleaning up our code on the dart


992
09:33:07,360 --> 09:33:11,512
site so on the dart side so let's have a look at this code that


993
09:33:11,512 --> 09:33:14,400
we've written in here i'm going to change the screen layout a little bit so


994
09:33:14,400 --> 09:33:19,040
you see it better so let's go to this function gets notes


995
09:33:19,040 --> 09:33:22,800
and you may have noticed it but gets notes at the moment we're not using this


996
09:33:22,800 --> 09:33:28,160
function at the moment so we're only using all nodes so let's go ahead and


997
09:33:28,160 --> 09:33:31,912
just remove this gets notes from firebase cloud storage okay


998
09:33:31,912 --> 09:33:35,680
just like that i'm running the application at the


999
09:33:35,680 --> 09:33:39,832
moment so let's just command s and i can see there's no problems because no one


1000
09:33:39,832 --> 09:33:43,120
is actually using get notes and there's no


1001
09:33:43,120 --> 09:33:46,720
errors in our code you can see there's no files or folders that are marked as


1002
09:33:46,720 --> 09:33:50,080
red so um so that's that one that was one of


1003
09:33:50,080 --> 09:33:52,960
the things that we have to do just to remove the get nodes


1004
09:33:52,960 --> 09:33:57,120
and then what we need to do in here is to ensure that our when we're actually


1005
09:33:57,120 --> 09:34:04,000
saying all notes that we are filtering the snapshots before we actually read


1006
09:34:04,000 --> 09:34:09,760
them so let's just go in here and say notes and before snapshots f like this


1007
09:34:09,760 --> 09:34:13,760
i'm gonna say where and you can see it says okay which field


1008
09:34:13,760 --> 09:34:16,552
are you looking for then we say owner user id


1009
09:34:16,552 --> 09:34:21,360
field name and that should actually be is equal to


1010
09:34:21,360 --> 09:34:26,320
and we have the owner it's ready right


1011
09:34:26,320 --> 09:34:32,872
so that's that one and then after that we say snapshot and snapshots map


1012
09:34:32,872 --> 09:34:37,680
and that's also fine actually so


1013
09:34:37,680 --> 09:34:40,720
in to be honest with you we could clean this code up as well so let's just say


1014
09:34:40,720 --> 09:34:43,832
in here and we take this and we say this is our


1015
09:34:43,832 --> 09:34:46,872
notes excuse me


1016
09:34:46,872 --> 09:34:53,832
the final notes is equal to that for all notes


1017
09:34:53,832 --> 09:34:59,272
and we could just return it all right so now we have this and you


1018
09:34:59,272 --> 09:35:04,400
could basically argue saying that okay we have a where clause in here so we


1019
09:35:04,400 --> 09:35:08,960
don't have to have this word clause in here and i would actually say yeah that


1020
09:35:08,960 --> 09:35:13,272
does make sense because yeah why would we have two word clauses so let's just


1021
09:35:13,272 --> 09:35:16,400
remove that word clause and put the semicolon in here


1022
09:35:16,400 --> 09:35:21,040
okay so we filter before we read all the snapshots all right we're getting an


1023
09:35:21,040 --> 09:35:24,480
error in here let me see what the problem could be because there's a map


1024
09:35:24,480 --> 09:35:27,192
all right so your code basically should look like


1025
09:35:27,192 --> 09:35:31,360
this right now and what we can do now is to actually


1026
09:35:31,360 --> 09:35:35,120
put this to test to make sure everything's working as expected so i'm


1027
09:35:35,120 --> 09:35:38,872
gonna bring our ios simulator in here which the application is running on


1028
09:35:38,872 --> 09:35:43,680
already gonna do a hot restart and let's just register a user so i'm just gonna


1029
09:35:43,680 --> 09:35:46,480
say van.np


1030
09:35:46,480 --> 09:35:51,680
gmail.com foo barbeaus and please don't use this uh password say register and


1031
09:35:51,680 --> 09:35:56,320
then it says verify email okay and let me go ahead and bring up my


1032
09:35:56,320 --> 09:36:01,592
mails and have a look at my email and see if a


1033
09:36:01,592 --> 09:36:08,160
verification email has been sent to me and we've sent an email verification


1034
09:36:08,160 --> 09:36:12,480
please open it to verify your account and i hope i actually entered my email


1035
09:36:12,480 --> 09:36:16,960
correctly because i haven't yet received a verification email


1036
09:36:16,960 --> 09:36:22,960
so perhaps i could open up gmail in a separate tab because i'm using gmail at


1037
09:36:22,960 --> 09:36:28,872
the moment for that particular user and see if that email has appeared in my


1038
09:36:28,872 --> 09:36:32,320
gmail inbox okay


1039
09:36:32,320 --> 09:36:36,160
i'm gonna switch users all right let's see


1040
09:36:36,160 --> 09:36:39,760
and this is i'm doing this on a separate screen so that's why you're not seeing


1041
09:36:39,760 --> 09:36:44,232
any of this happening um i can't see really any email at the


1042
09:36:44,232 --> 09:36:49,832
moment so um let me go ahead in our firebase console in here so


1043
09:36:49,832 --> 09:36:54,872
um let's go here and let's go then to authentication and


1044
09:36:54,872 --> 09:37:00,720
i can see that there is a user here and that is actually correct but i don't see


1045
09:37:00,720 --> 09:37:06,160
any verification email being sent to me so let's go ahead and have a look at our


1046
09:37:06,160 --> 09:37:09,680
register view and let's have a look at the button


1047
09:37:09,680 --> 09:37:14,080
implementation if we actually forgot to do something so when we pass this


1048
09:37:14,080 --> 09:37:18,320
register event you can see auth event register then we have to go to our off


1049
09:37:18,320 --> 09:37:21,592
block and have a look at how we've implemented


1050
09:37:21,592 --> 09:37:25,512
implemented that i can see that we say create user and then we're awaiting on


1051
09:37:25,512 --> 09:37:31,120
the provider send email verification so it seems to be working fine however i


1052
09:37:31,120 --> 09:37:34,552
still haven't received any verification email and that's why i'm just going to


1053
09:37:34,552 --> 09:37:37,912
say send email verification here on this screen


1054
09:37:37,912 --> 09:37:41,680
and by pressing that i'm just going to refresh my emails and now i can see i


1055
09:37:41,680 --> 09:37:46,160
received a verification email i'm going to bring it here tap on the link and i


1056
09:37:46,160 --> 09:37:50,160
can see that i saw this um i can see that


1057
09:37:50,160 --> 09:37:54,480
your email has been verified was displayed to me so


1058
09:37:54,480 --> 09:37:59,760
that's great let's go ahead now and um go to the application and i'm going to


1059
09:37:59,760 --> 09:38:04,080
restart here go to the login page and i'm going to log in with that user


1060
09:38:04,080 --> 09:38:06,800
fu barbaz


1061
09:38:06,800 --> 09:38:10,552
log in with the user and no problems i can log into the application press the


1062
09:38:10,552 --> 09:38:13,192
plus button and i'm going to say my first note


1063
09:38:13,192 --> 09:38:16,640
okay that's saved and then i'm going to save


1064
09:38:16,640 --> 09:38:21,272
my second note all right and that is also saved then


1065
09:38:21,272 --> 09:38:25,360
i'm going to log out and try to log back in with another user


1066
09:38:25,360 --> 09:38:30,320
so let's register a new user because remember we deleted all our users from


1067
09:38:30,320 --> 09:38:34,960
firestore database so who are about again please don't use this password


1068
09:38:34,960 --> 09:38:38,800
and i'm going to have a look at my emails then


1069
09:38:38,800 --> 09:38:42,640
and i can actually see a new verification email was sent to me so


1070
09:38:42,640 --> 09:38:46,080
that's perfect i'm going to bring it here


1071
09:38:46,080 --> 09:38:51,120
if i can open that email it looks like this i'm going to verify my user great


1072
09:38:51,120 --> 09:38:55,760
then i'm going to restart the process and try to log in with that user


1073
09:38:55,760 --> 09:38:58,320
okay through barbaz


1074
09:38:58,320 --> 09:39:02,000
log in with the user and i can't see van dot's


1075
09:39:02,000 --> 09:39:08,000
notes so i'm going to say another first note


1076
09:39:08,000 --> 09:39:11,512
another first note and


1077
09:39:11,512 --> 09:39:16,872
create a new note say another second note all right so after these two users


1078
09:39:16,872 --> 09:39:21,912
have created their own two individual notes let's go ahead in our database


1079
09:39:21,912 --> 09:39:26,080
refresh the users we can see there are two users in here one starting with pg


1080
09:39:26,080 --> 09:39:31,192
which is this pixelity and then there's a 9v which is the other user okay


1081
09:39:31,192 --> 09:39:34,640
let's go to our database and see how many nodes we have and we can see we


1082
09:39:34,640 --> 09:39:36,960
have four nodes 9v


1083
09:39:36,960 --> 09:39:41,040
9v which is for default.user and then we have two


1084
09:39:41,040 --> 09:39:46,552
um documents created by the pixelity email which start with the


1085
09:39:46,552 --> 09:39:52,552
user id of pg as you can see in here and they they have full access to their own


1086
09:39:52,552 --> 09:39:57,120
documents so now this user you can actually go and delete this document for


1087
09:39:57,120 --> 09:40:01,512
instance another first note so he can go and say okay i want to delete this note


1088
09:40:01,512 --> 09:40:04,552
so boom and you can see it just immediately got


1089
09:40:04,552 --> 09:40:09,512
deleted from firebase as well so they have full access to their own notes


1090
09:40:09,512 --> 09:40:14,000
but they have absolutely no access to anybody else's notes alright so that's


1091
09:40:14,000 --> 09:40:18,720
working fantastically if that's even a word fantastically


1092
09:40:18,720 --> 09:40:22,800
so the next thing we need to do now that we fix this is to go ahead and update


1093
09:40:22,800 --> 09:40:27,760
the build number in our pop spec yaml file so now i'll show you this let's go


1094
09:40:27,760 --> 09:40:31,680
to visual studio code to our code right here and then say pop spec


1095
09:40:31,680 --> 09:40:35,360
um camel and you'll see on top of this file


1096
09:40:35,360 --> 09:40:38,720
somewhere around here we have this version at the moment is one zero zero


1097
09:40:38,720 --> 09:40:43,680
plus one but what we want to do in here is just is to say it's one one zero plus


1098
09:40:43,680 --> 09:40:48,720
one so we're updating our build number in here as well okay


1099
09:40:48,720 --> 09:40:54,720
so after doing that since it's such a big change you could perhaps look at


1100
09:40:54,720 --> 09:41:00,000
your terminal and see and do a git status and you can see by updating that


1101
09:41:00,000 --> 09:41:05,040
build number in here um it didn't immediately update the build


1102
09:41:05,040 --> 09:41:09,192
number for our application because had it done that it should have also been


1103
09:41:09,192 --> 09:41:14,080
updated for our ios application in the info plist file so that unfortunately


1104
09:41:14,080 --> 09:41:18,400
wasn't updated and because of this it's probably a good idea to issue flutter


1105
09:41:18,400 --> 09:41:22,552
clean so i'm going to bring the code like that let's just say flutter


1106
09:41:22,552 --> 09:41:25,832
clean okay


1107
09:41:26,400 --> 09:41:30,872
that's gonna do its work and let's say flutter


1108
09:41:30,872 --> 09:41:33,592
pop get


1109
09:41:34,872 --> 09:41:39,160
that and


1110
09:41:39,360 --> 09:41:42,720
all right that's doing is we're going to say git status let's have a look at our


1111
09:41:42,720 --> 09:41:48,480
status and there's still nothing changed so let's just say flutter run ios


1112
09:41:49,680 --> 09:41:53,592
and see if that's gonna listen okay flutter run because that's our default


1113
09:41:53,592 --> 09:41:58,480
target at the moment is an ios simulator so maybe flutter rom will just accept


1114
09:41:58,480 --> 09:42:02,552
multiple devices found all right


1115
09:42:02,552 --> 09:42:06,832
show us the list of devices please


1116
09:42:08,480 --> 09:42:12,640
perhaps it's having oh now it found it please


1117
09:42:12,640 --> 09:42:17,832
choose one okay i want to choose the iphone 13 pro so i'm gonna choose um


1118
09:42:17,832 --> 09:42:23,440
iphone 13 pro number two in here okay so now it's gonna build the project with


1119
09:42:23,440 --> 09:42:26,232
xcode build and in my experience these days


1120
09:42:26,232 --> 09:42:30,720
xcode build has been it's just horribly slow so


1121
09:42:30,720 --> 09:42:35,680
i'm basically gonna stay quiet now let it do its work and when it's done we


1122
09:42:35,680 --> 09:42:41,440
will continue with the video all right as i suspected this process


1123
09:42:41,440 --> 09:42:45,832
actually took a very long time and i think we could actually see in here that


1124
09:42:45,832 --> 09:42:50,720
the xcode build took 164 seconds


1125
09:42:50,720 --> 09:42:55,272
it is well i'm not going to go into that it's a long time um so let's have a look


1126
09:42:55,272 --> 09:42:59,360
now if the version was actually updated correctly so i'm going to go another


1127
09:42:59,360 --> 09:43:04,320
into another shell in here and let's say git status and i still don't see any


1128
09:43:04,320 --> 09:43:08,160
info plist files have been getting changed on the ios side so i'm just


1129
09:43:08,160 --> 09:43:12,872
gonna be curious here and then go to the ios file in here and have a look at the


1130
09:43:12,872 --> 09:43:16,960
xcode workspace and let's have a look at the version in


1131
09:43:16,960 --> 09:43:20,872
here well the version does seem to have been updated so it's 1 1 0 that's


1132
09:43:20,872 --> 09:43:26,000
exactly what we specified in our pop spec yaml so that's you making sure that


1133
09:43:26,000 --> 09:43:29,592
this file is updated and if you don't have xcode so if you're for instance


1134
09:43:29,592 --> 09:43:32,160
running on linux


1135
09:43:32,160 --> 09:43:35,592
ubuntu or something and you want to still check whether the version number


1136
09:43:35,592 --> 09:43:39,592
was updated for the ios application you can always do that by opening up this


1137
09:43:39,592 --> 09:43:44,960
file info plist inside ios runner and then you can have i believe you


1138
09:43:44,960 --> 09:43:49,120
could have a look at your flutter build number in here and


1139
09:43:49,120 --> 09:43:53,592
let's see if flutter build number is set somewhere


1140
09:43:53,592 --> 09:43:57,192
that one that one i don't actually see the flutter build


1141
09:43:57,192 --> 09:44:01,680
number being set anywhere so if we search for one one zero


1142
09:44:01,680 --> 09:44:05,360
actually let's search for one one zero in the entire application and the only


1143
09:44:05,360 --> 09:44:09,120
thing i can see in here are like some of our pop specs


1144
09:44:09,120 --> 09:44:13,040
and one one zero in here so


1145
09:44:13,040 --> 09:44:18,080
unfortunately that's not gonna work so i don't really know the magic behind how


1146
09:44:18,080 --> 09:44:22,000
the flutter team has actually injected that 110 into


1147
09:44:22,000 --> 09:44:26,400
it's probably some sort of a build variable so if you want to get into


1148
09:44:26,400 --> 09:44:29,680
details about that perhaps we could just open xcode


1149
09:44:29,680 --> 09:44:34,480
and have a look at that application let's go in here into build settings and


1150
09:44:34,480 --> 09:44:39,832
have a look at the version um and see if there's any one one zero


1151
09:44:39,832 --> 09:44:43,512
in here flutter build name exactly so that's that's how they're injecting it


1152
09:44:43,512 --> 09:44:47,760
they have a user defined variable called slots are built and flutter build the


1153
09:44:47,760 --> 09:44:51,760
name is then being injected for our info p list so


1154
09:44:51,760 --> 09:44:56,000
if you go here you can see oh this is flutter build number so yeah but anyway


1155
09:44:56,000 --> 09:45:00,000
it's this this must be a variable that the flutter team has injected into the


1156
09:45:00,000 --> 09:45:05,040
xcode build somehow all right but bringing up xcode could confirm that


1157
09:45:05,040 --> 09:45:09,680
the version number is set to 110 correctly so that's all we needed to do


1158
09:45:09,680 --> 09:45:13,360
then the next step for this chapter for us is to


1159
09:45:13,360 --> 09:45:16,552
make a build and send it to apple this time so


1160
09:45:16,552 --> 09:45:19,592
not this time we did it the previous time as well we sent it to apple so what


1161
09:45:19,592 --> 09:45:23,592
i'm going to do is i need to bring up xcode again i shouldn't have closed it


1162
09:45:23,592 --> 09:45:28,320
maybe let's go in here and while we're in there we could just go and say we're


1163
09:45:28,320 --> 09:45:32,872
building for any ios device and then i'm just going to say product archive as


1164
09:45:32,872 --> 09:45:35,512
we've done in the previous chapters as well


1165
09:45:35,512 --> 09:45:38,720
so let it do its work


1166
09:45:38,960 --> 09:45:44,552
okay now our build has been um created by xcode and in here it's very important


1167
09:45:44,552 --> 09:45:47,360
that you actually check that the version number in here


1168
09:45:47,360 --> 09:45:51,192
corresponds to the version number that you've created in app store connect and


1169
09:45:51,192 --> 09:45:55,192
just a reminder in app store connect if you go back there you can see that the


1170
09:45:55,192 --> 09:45:58,480
version that we prepared is 110 and that's why i said in the beginning of


1171
09:45:58,480 --> 09:46:02,080
this chapter it's actually important for you to follow the same versioning that


1172
09:46:02,080 --> 09:46:06,160
i'm doing in in the current chapter so let's say 110 and i'm going to say


1173
09:46:06,160 --> 09:46:10,720
distribute to apple or distribute app upload


1174
09:46:10,720 --> 09:46:13,760
and let's go in here


1175
09:46:16,080 --> 09:46:20,480
analyzing app version fetching app store configuration


1176
09:46:20,480 --> 09:46:24,552
and i'm going to uncheck manage version and build number because i want flutter


1177
09:46:24,552 --> 09:46:29,592
to be able to do that and then i'm going to choose the production profile that


1178
09:46:29,592 --> 09:46:35,040
we've created for application press the next button in here as well


1179
09:46:35,360 --> 09:46:39,680
and then depending on your network connection and your and different


1180
09:46:39,680 --> 09:46:42,872
configurations that you have for your network this process could actually take


1181
09:46:42,872 --> 09:46:47,592
a very very long time previously when i tried this even even


1182
09:46:47,592 --> 09:46:50,960
though i'm on a fiber optic net network connection


1183
09:46:50,960 --> 09:46:55,512
with a thousand upload a thousand download it still took about 30 minutes


1184
09:46:55,512 --> 09:46:59,592
for a simple application to be sent to apple and it was literally stuck in this


1185
09:46:59,592 --> 09:47:03,360
requesting app information for more than 20 minutes so


1186
09:47:03,360 --> 09:47:07,760
that's an unfortunate fact that we just have to accept and let it do its work


1187
09:47:07,760 --> 09:47:11,040
and i will see you then once it's


1188
09:47:11,040 --> 09:47:15,760
finally sent the application to apple all right so now i can see that our


1189
09:47:15,760 --> 09:47:18,960
application has been submitted to apple and i have to confess that this time it


1190
09:47:18,960 --> 09:47:22,800
took only about a minute for this process to go through so that was very


1191
09:47:22,800 --> 09:47:26,640
fast much much faster than the previous chapters we'd have to submit our


1192
09:47:26,640 --> 09:47:30,000
application which took upwards of 30 minutes for me


1193
09:47:30,000 --> 09:47:33,680
so now that it's done after you've done this you will receive an email from


1194
09:47:33,680 --> 09:47:37,512
apple that kind of looks like this if i can bring it to the screen


1195
09:47:37,512 --> 09:47:40,232
it will look like this and it will tell you that


1196
09:47:40,232 --> 09:47:45,040
the following build has completed processing only after this email has


1197
09:47:45,040 --> 09:47:48,320
been sent you can go to app store connect and


1198
09:47:48,320 --> 09:47:52,480
go and we also have to fix our missing compliance so let's just say manage and


1199
09:47:52,480 --> 09:47:54,960
say use encryption no


1200
09:47:54,960 --> 09:48:00,552
start internal testing after you've done that you need to go to the app store


1201
09:48:00,640 --> 09:48:04,400
how do you say tab and in that tab let's just select a new


1202
09:48:04,400 --> 09:48:09,680
bill and it's our 110 build and i'm going to say done in there okay after


1203
09:48:09,680 --> 09:48:13,040
you've done that you can press the save button and then you can submit your


1204
09:48:13,040 --> 09:48:17,680
application fresh to apple so that


1205
09:48:17,680 --> 09:48:23,440
then in turn concludes the submission of our app to app store and um if there's


1206
09:48:23,440 --> 09:48:26,400
any complications with this application like if apple for some reason can't


1207
09:48:26,400 --> 09:48:29,592
register a user or something they're going to send you an email telling you


1208
09:48:29,592 --> 09:48:33,040
about that so then you need to go through that process


1209
09:48:33,040 --> 09:48:37,360
and help the app store review team in order to get started with


1210
09:48:37,360 --> 09:48:40,160
your application but if you remember from the previous chapters we've


1211
09:48:40,160 --> 09:48:44,960
actually left some information in there like review information


1212
09:48:44,960 --> 09:48:50,000
and told the review team how to register for a


1213
09:48:50,000 --> 09:48:52,872
user in our application so that information should be sufficient for


1214
09:48:52,872 --> 09:48:57,592
them to understand how to use the app fantastic we're done with the origin


1215
09:48:57,592 --> 09:49:03,192
with the submission of our ios app to app store so as usual since we've now


1216
09:49:03,192 --> 09:49:07,912
changed our code let's go into visual studio code and


1217
09:49:07,912 --> 09:49:11,832
i'm going to close all these tabs because it's just extremely populated on


1218
09:49:11,832 --> 09:49:17,192
my screen get rid of the explorer and go to


1219
09:49:17,192 --> 09:49:21,680
my terminal in here and have a look at art status and i can see there's only


1220
09:49:21,680 --> 09:49:26,800
two files changed so i'm going to add them and let's commit as step 30 as you


1221
09:49:26,800 --> 09:49:30,232
can see at the bottom of the screen okay so if you look at our logs we have step


1222
09:49:30,232 --> 09:49:34,400
29 and then we have step 30 so i'm going to say git push


1223
09:49:34,400 --> 09:49:40,160
that's going to push our commit and less than a tag v so step 30 and


1224
09:49:40,160 --> 09:49:46,872
let's just say get push tags so that is done now and our tag of 30 is


1225
09:49:46,872 --> 09:49:51,440
also sent to a github what we need to do now as usual is


1226
09:49:51,440 --> 09:49:55,592
tradition where we talk about what we need to discuss in the upcoming chapters


1227
09:49:55,592 --> 09:50:00,160
and in the next chapter we're going to talk about sending our app also to


1228
09:50:00,160 --> 09:50:03,832
google play store we've done it for ios we have to do the same process for


1229
09:50:03,832 --> 09:50:06,552
google play store so get some refreshments if you want to and i'll see


1230
09:50:06,552 --> 09:50:10,160
you in the next chapter hello everyone and welcome to chapter 50 of the slotted


1231
09:50:10,160 --> 09:50:13,360
course in previous chapters we've been working quite a lot with submitting our


1232
09:50:13,360 --> 09:50:18,320
application for the ios app store using app store connect and in this chapter


1233
09:50:18,320 --> 09:50:21,360
we're going to focus on doing the same thing but for


1234
09:50:21,360 --> 09:50:25,680
google and play store so whereas you have app store and at the back of app


1235
09:50:25,680 --> 09:50:29,912
store you have the um app store connect which allows you as


1236
09:50:29,912 --> 09:50:32,872
a developer to go and interact with the your product that's going to be


1237
09:50:32,872 --> 09:50:37,040
submitted to the app store google has something similar for your product for


1238
09:50:37,040 --> 09:50:40,720
your android app in this case our flutter application to be available in


1239
09:50:40,720 --> 09:50:43,912
the google play store which is where users download your


1240
09:50:43,912 --> 09:50:50,872
applications you you as a developer will have to go to the google play console so


1241
09:50:50,872 --> 09:50:53,512
we're going to take care of that and for that we're going to create something


1242
09:50:53,512 --> 09:50:58,480
called an app bundle where whereas if you remember when we created our ios


1243
09:50:58,480 --> 09:51:01,440
application we went to xcode and archive our application and that created


1244
09:51:01,440 --> 09:51:05,680
something called an xc archive file and that was kind of like a zip file


1245
09:51:05,680 --> 09:51:09,360
and all your files were all your binaries at least all your like linked


1246
09:51:09,360 --> 09:51:15,680
libraries all your pods the application itself binary was signed with your


1247
09:51:15,680 --> 09:51:19,760
production certificate and profile an app bundle for


1248
09:51:19,760 --> 09:51:25,360
your um android devices as well is a signed bundle so it is the equivalent of


1249
09:51:25,360 --> 09:51:30,160
your um xc archive kind of and we're going to take care of that as well soon


1250
09:51:30,160 --> 09:51:34,800
in this chapter and we have a um


1251
09:51:34,800 --> 09:51:37,912
i mean there's something that i i actually prefer this but i didn't want


1252
09:51:37,912 --> 09:51:41,512
to mention it before because we were so close to actually raising our ios


1253
09:51:41,512 --> 09:51:44,800
application we have to make just some small adjustments to our code as well as


1254
09:51:44,800 --> 09:51:49,592
you'll soon see when we start for instance working with


1255
09:51:49,592 --> 09:51:53,760
taking screenshots of our android of our flutter app running on various android


1256
09:51:53,760 --> 09:51:59,592
devices and that's um a scrolling issue that we have generally on our


1257
09:51:59,592 --> 09:52:03,440
screens where we display the keyboard those screens are


1258
09:52:03,440 --> 09:52:06,800
um login view and i believe there's


1259
09:52:06,800 --> 09:52:11,360
register view and where else do we display a keyword i


1260
09:52:11,360 --> 09:52:15,360
believe we also log in register for a got password view


1261
09:52:15,360 --> 09:52:19,120
because we asked the user for her email address there as well and also


1262
09:52:19,120 --> 09:52:23,192
one year for instance um actually we don't have the problem on


1263
09:52:23,192 --> 09:52:26,480
the edit notes view so that's not a problem so


1264
09:52:26,480 --> 09:52:30,160
we have this problem in verify email view login view register view and forgot


1265
09:52:30,160 --> 09:52:33,760
password view so um


1266
09:52:33,760 --> 09:52:37,192
actually verify email view you could argue that yeah it's it's not a problem


1267
09:52:37,192 --> 09:52:39,680
but so the issue that we have at the moment


1268
09:52:39,680 --> 09:52:43,512
is that imagine that your application application is being run on a very small


1269
09:52:43,512 --> 09:52:46,160
screen and um


1270
09:52:46,160 --> 09:52:49,680
and then the user for instance has a very very small screen and then they're


1271
09:52:49,680 --> 09:52:53,760
on the login view and then we displayed the keyboard where at where for instance


1272
09:52:53,760 --> 09:52:57,680
they tap on the email field and they try to write their email and then the


1273
09:52:57,680 --> 09:53:01,912
keyboard pops up blocking like half the screen and depending on the size of the


1274
09:53:01,912 --> 09:53:05,120
screen the rest of the half that is remaining might not actually be able to


1275
09:53:05,120 --> 09:53:08,640
display the entire contents of your view


1276
09:53:08,640 --> 09:53:11,192
so this is a little problem and we have to


1277
09:53:11,192 --> 09:53:16,160
fix it but it is so simple to fix and you may then decide to say well the ios


1278
09:53:16,160 --> 09:53:20,480
application we've done already is sent to apple it's um it's already accepted


1279
09:53:20,480 --> 09:53:22,960
and i'm going to release it and you could definitely do that so it's


1280
09:53:22,960 --> 09:53:26,800
actually good practice if you want to release your is application as is just


1281
09:53:26,800 --> 09:53:30,800
go ahead and do that and then you can do a patch later and release another


1282
09:53:30,800 --> 09:53:34,960
application to fix that issue and i think the more you release


1283
09:53:34,960 --> 09:53:40,400
applications the better because then you learn the process of updating things and


1284
09:53:40,400 --> 09:53:44,832
sending release notes etc it's just good practice to do that quite


1285
09:53:44,832 --> 09:53:51,912
often so let's go ahead now and talk a little bit about the documentation for


1286
09:53:52,232 --> 09:53:55,272
creating an app bundle so i'll bring it up


1287
09:53:55,272 --> 09:53:58,552
here and it's as you can see at the bottom of


1288
09:53:58,552 --> 09:54:03,192
the screen it's in distribute console and um


1289
09:54:03,192 --> 09:54:07,120
there's a lot of documentation here that you can go and read more about it so i


1290
09:54:07,120 --> 09:54:12,400
thought just to um explain like the google play console in here a little bit


1291
09:54:12,400 --> 09:54:16,320
to you so that you can sign in here and then you can read more about all


1292
09:54:16,320 --> 09:54:21,040
these topics so i think it's just a good url for you to um


1293
09:54:21,040 --> 09:54:24,232
bookmark if you want to be able to release your application in the future


1294
09:54:24,232 --> 09:54:28,800
as well with google and play store otherwise if you're like me and you


1295
09:54:28,800 --> 09:54:32,080
sometimes just want to jump into things you could start by


1296
09:54:32,080 --> 09:54:39,272
um logging into google play console so let me bring you to the next url as you


1297
09:54:39,272 --> 09:54:45,872
can see the url is played at google.com console about so i'm just gonna say um


1298
09:54:45,872 --> 09:54:51,440
play.google.com slash console slash out


1299
09:54:51,440 --> 09:54:55,832
if i can spell and that's our google play console okay


1300
09:54:55,832 --> 09:54:59,680
and i'm just going to log in here with my


1301
09:54:59,680 --> 09:55:04,000
a user account and i have this user account here which i can log in with


1302
09:55:04,000 --> 09:55:07,912
let's see if i can log in successfully with that


1303
09:55:07,912 --> 09:55:13,040
all right and then it says choose developer again and if you haven't done


1304
09:55:13,040 --> 09:55:18,160
this before you may have to go and create a developer account first but i


1305
09:55:18,160 --> 09:55:20,320
but in the beginning of this chapter we


1306
09:55:20,320 --> 09:55:24,000
talked quite a lot about creating a developer account both for ios and


1307
09:55:24,000 --> 09:55:27,680
android so i'm assuming you've already done that but if you haven't you can go


1308
09:55:27,680 --> 09:55:31,040
and create a developer account it is free you don't have to pay for anything


1309
09:55:31,040 --> 09:55:35,192
so just go ahead and create your developer account


1310
09:55:35,192 --> 09:55:38,640
so now here i'm going to choose my developer account and just go in here


1311
09:55:38,640 --> 09:55:43,440
okay so here's my google play console as you can see in here this


1312
09:55:43,440 --> 09:55:49,360
is the console url for me at least and what we need to do in here is to go


1313
09:55:49,360 --> 09:55:55,040
ahead and create an app so let's go ahead as you can see at the


1314
09:55:55,040 --> 09:55:59,192
bottom of the screen let's go ahead and tap on create app in here and now in


1315
09:55:59,192 --> 09:56:04,080
here it's asking us for some information


1316
09:56:04,160 --> 09:56:09,512
um and also i just saw that i have a little um


1317
09:56:09,512 --> 09:56:13,832
ipo in my action so i'll bring the right caption


1318
09:56:13,832 --> 09:56:17,512
up in here and you'll see that we have to go through these steps in order to


1319
09:56:17,512 --> 09:56:22,720
create our application all right so i'm gonna go in here and let's just say my


1320
09:56:22,720 --> 09:56:25,272
awesome


1321
09:56:25,440 --> 09:56:28,320
notes the default language let's just leave it


1322
09:56:28,320 --> 09:56:32,872
as english us and and it asks you is it an app or a game then we're gonna say


1323
09:56:32,872 --> 09:56:36,320
it's an application and it's a free application


1324
09:56:36,320 --> 09:56:41,440
and and and we're going to say it it meets the developer policies and accept


1325
09:56:41,440 --> 09:56:46,832
us export laws okay and then we create the application this may take some


1326
09:56:46,832 --> 09:56:52,552
time okay so what we need to do now is to go through


1327
09:56:52,552 --> 09:56:56,320
um app access in here so i'm going to bring


1328
09:56:56,320 --> 09:57:01,120
up the caption so we need to go through let's see if


1329
09:57:01,120 --> 09:57:04,400
you can actually find the provided information about your app and as you


1330
09:57:04,400 --> 09:57:07,272
can see it's right here provide information about your app and set up


1331
09:57:07,272 --> 09:57:11,512
your store listening okay so i'm gonna have a look at that and these are the


1332
09:57:11,512 --> 09:57:14,800
things you have to go through and we're actually gonna go through this together


1333
09:57:14,800 --> 09:57:18,800
to in order to be able to create a listing for your application so it's a


1334
09:57:18,800 --> 09:57:25,360
good check checklist basically um and i have to say i mean i'm more used to


1335
09:57:25,360 --> 09:57:29,512
the app store connect interface it's a little bit like less cluttered i find


1336
09:57:29,512 --> 09:57:32,800
google play console a little bit more cluttered to be honest with you and


1337
09:57:32,800 --> 09:57:36,552
things are just there are so much in your face but once


1338
09:57:36,552 --> 09:57:40,232
you get used to it i think you'll understand the purpose and


1339
09:57:40,232 --> 09:57:44,320
and then you'll just as as long as you know where to find things so in the


1340
09:57:44,320 --> 09:57:48,640
dashboard and for your application just scroll down to set up your app provide


1341
09:57:48,640 --> 09:57:52,480
information here about your app instead of your store listing and let's go to


1342
09:57:52,480 --> 09:57:57,832
app access and set that up okay and then here is asking us okay is there


1343
09:57:57,832 --> 09:58:00,720
any restricted content that we're going to say


1344
09:58:00,720 --> 09:58:05,120
all functionalities available without special access press the save button


1345
09:58:05,120 --> 09:58:09,272
and you can see for instance i saved it and now i have to manually go back to


1346
09:58:09,272 --> 09:58:13,832
the dashboard it could have just saved it and sent me back but no it doesn't do


1347
09:58:13,832 --> 09:58:18,552
that so app access is now crossed out as you can see all right


1348
09:58:18,552 --> 09:58:22,800
let's go to the ad section so for the ads we're gonna say no my app does not


1349
09:58:22,800 --> 09:58:27,360
contain ads okay press the save button and then dashboard button


1350
09:58:27,360 --> 09:58:33,040
so that's for ads and let's go ahead and take care of


1351
09:58:33,040 --> 09:58:36,232
content rating and this is kind of like what we have to do for app store connect


1352
09:58:36,232 --> 09:58:39,680
as well in order to for instance say our application doesn't contain violence it


1353
09:58:39,680 --> 09:58:43,512
doesn't contain mature content etc so let's go to


1354
09:58:43,512 --> 09:58:47,272
content rating and say start questionnaire


1355
09:58:47,272 --> 09:58:51,192
and let's just fill in our email address so in here i'm just gonna


1356
09:58:51,192 --> 09:58:58,080
provide if i can spell support at a pixelity


1357
09:58:58,080 --> 09:59:02,000
i have some problems right now uh


1358
09:59:02,000 --> 09:59:06,640
support at pixelity ab.sc and i believe yeah that's my


1359
09:59:06,640 --> 09:59:11,512
website so um so i think that's that's the email i've


1360
09:59:11,512 --> 09:59:15,760
been using in app store connect as well so uh let me also


1361
09:59:15,760 --> 09:59:18,720
just double check that in my notes so i'm gonna bring this into a separate


1362
09:59:18,720 --> 09:59:23,192
website just i'm gonna check this in my website um


1363
09:59:23,192 --> 09:59:27,272
and i think the it is actually so i'm not using this


1364
09:59:27,272 --> 09:59:30,720
anymore so let's just pick some of the appointments and here you just have to


1365
09:59:30,720 --> 09:59:35,680
enter your own email so don't enter my email here so this is in case they need


1366
09:59:35,680 --> 09:59:38,720
as you can see if in case they need to contact you so the category of our


1367
09:59:38,720 --> 09:59:42,960
application we say all other app types because it's not a game or social or a


1368
09:59:42,960 --> 09:59:47,680
communication application so next does the app contain any rating


1369
09:59:47,680 --> 09:59:51,360
ratings relevant content downloaded as part of the app package


1370
09:59:51,360 --> 09:59:54,800
code or assets no


1371
09:59:54,800 --> 09:59:58,400
and user accountant does the app natively allow users to interact or


1372
09:59:58,400 --> 10:00:03,832
exchange content with other users through the voice communication text no


1373
10:00:03,832 --> 10:00:07,360
then let's say online content does the app feature


1374
10:00:07,360 --> 10:00:10,960
promote content that isn't part of the initial app download but can be accessed


1375
10:00:10,960 --> 10:00:15,512
from the app no promotion or sale of age restricted


1376
10:00:15,512 --> 10:00:19,760
products no miscellaneous does the app share the user's current and precise


1377
10:00:19,760 --> 10:00:24,000
physical location nope um does the app allow users to purchase


1378
10:00:24,000 --> 10:00:28,640
purchase digital goods no is the app a web browser or search engine


1379
10:00:28,640 --> 10:00:32,232
no is he a primarily a news or educational


1380
10:00:32,232 --> 10:00:37,760
product no okay so we save this and we go to the next page summary and


1381
10:00:37,760 --> 10:00:43,040
you can see it says rating of 30 in brazil all ages peggy 3


1382
10:00:43,040 --> 10:00:46,960
everyone can use this application rate it for three plus


1383
10:00:46,960 --> 10:00:49,440
not sure to be honest with you with that three plus


1384
10:00:49,440 --> 10:00:53,360
um and then we could just say


1385
10:00:53,360 --> 10:00:56,552
submit all right


1386
10:00:56,872 --> 10:00:59,512
so that part is done


1387
10:00:59,512 --> 10:01:03,760
seems like it and then we can we can just go to our dashboard


1388
10:01:03,760 --> 10:01:08,232
okay and then let's go and take out our target audience


1389
10:01:08,232 --> 10:01:16,640
and we say in here we choose 13 to 15 16 to 17 18 and over can also use


1390
10:01:16,640 --> 10:01:20,552
our application okay and this is kind of like something you may decide on your


1391
10:01:20,552 --> 10:01:24,400
own whether like you you must add a privacy policy target audience inclusion


1392
10:01:24,400 --> 10:01:28,400
or under 13 and that's why we're not like targeting anybody under 13. and to


1393
10:01:28,400 --> 10:01:31,832
basically you may say oh my app's only suitable for 18 and plus and that's


1394
10:01:31,832 --> 10:01:35,192
that's that's completely up to you and you're more than welcome to do that but


1395
10:01:35,192 --> 10:01:40,800
i think our app is suitable even for 13 or even maybe less a 13 is quite a


1396
10:01:40,800 --> 10:01:44,480
basically like the sweet spot i would say yeah because if you go lower than


1397
10:01:44,480 --> 10:01:48,800
that then you'll have to provide like your privacy policy for those specific


1398
10:01:48,800 --> 10:01:51,760
targets so we're not gonna do that


1399
10:01:51,760 --> 10:01:55,592
and then we're gonna press the next button and let's have a look in here


1400
10:01:55,592 --> 10:01:59,832
what's asking us to do appeal to children could your store listing


1401
10:01:59,832 --> 10:02:04,552
unintentionally appear to children and we say yes


1402
10:02:04,552 --> 10:02:07,832
because um we may not want this app to be


1403
10:02:07,832 --> 10:02:12,872
appearing for children but it may appear nonetheless so let's just say yes there


1404
10:02:12,872 --> 10:02:18,232
and in here you can see the target group is 13 to 18. so that's great now we


1405
10:02:18,232 --> 10:02:22,232
saved it and let's go back to our dashboard and you can see here a target


1406
10:02:22,232 --> 10:02:26,872
audience is also done


1407
10:02:27,040 --> 10:02:31,592
so let's go to the new section in here news app is our app and news app and we


1408
10:02:31,592 --> 10:02:35,272
say no all right and then we save and go back


1409
10:02:35,272 --> 10:02:38,800
and you can see that the news app stuff is done


1410
10:02:38,800 --> 10:02:44,232
so let's now have a look at this covet 19 contact application and we say um


1411
10:02:44,232 --> 10:02:49,440
my app is not a publicly available code with 19 contact tracing or status app so


1412
10:02:49,440 --> 10:02:54,320
save it and we say go back to dashboard so that part of the application process


1413
10:02:54,320 --> 10:02:58,080
is also done now we have to fill in the data safety


1414
10:02:58,080 --> 10:03:00,640
stuff so let's go through all of these and


1415
10:03:00,640 --> 10:03:04,160
and this might take some time but that's okay does your app collector share any


1416
10:03:04,160 --> 10:03:08,800
of the required user data types required does your app collect or share any of


1417
10:03:08,800 --> 10:03:12,960
the required collect required


1418
10:03:12,960 --> 10:03:18,232
user data types what do they mean by required


1419
10:03:18,232 --> 10:03:22,232
personal information yeah we will collect email addresses so yes of course


1420
10:03:22,232 --> 10:03:25,512
so let's just say yes and


1421
10:03:25,512 --> 10:03:29,592
let's remove that is all of the user data collected about your app encrypted


1422
10:03:29,592 --> 10:03:33,592
in transit yes and that's because we're using firebase and that's using https so


1423
10:03:33,592 --> 10:03:37,272
that's encrypt in transit do you provide a way for users to request that their


1424
10:03:37,272 --> 10:03:41,592
data is deleted no we don't do that and i actually believe that it will be


1425
10:03:41,592 --> 10:03:45,592
really good if you did that so if you are curious about this and if


1426
10:03:45,592 --> 10:03:49,120
you want to allow the user for instance to be able to do that you could you


1427
10:03:49,120 --> 10:03:51,832
could check that out and see how you can request


1428
10:03:51,832 --> 10:03:56,000
their data to be deleted you can create a separate view for that for instance


1429
10:03:56,000 --> 10:04:01,680
and from there you can you can basically make an api call to firebase and delete


1430
10:04:01,680 --> 10:04:05,272
this user so you could do that if you want to okay and i may actually provide


1431
10:04:05,272 --> 10:04:08,320
a chapter for that i don't know but at the moment


1432
10:04:08,320 --> 10:04:12,960
we say no data types okay and let's have a look in


1433
10:04:12,960 --> 10:04:17,760
here this may take a quite a long time so let's have a look


1434
10:04:17,760 --> 10:04:20,960
um data types you must select any user data


1435
10:04:20,960 --> 10:04:24,800
that's are collected okay we're not doing um location


1436
10:04:24,800 --> 10:04:29,760
personal information and we're collecting email


1437
10:04:29,760 --> 10:04:32,872
personal identifier that relates to an identifiable person for example an


1438
10:04:32,872 --> 10:04:37,360
account id account number or account name yeah personal identifiers yeah


1439
10:04:37,360 --> 10:04:39,440
definitely um


1440
10:04:39,440 --> 10:04:43,360
and other personal info we're not collecting so we only have a user id and


1441
10:04:43,360 --> 10:04:46,552
an email address and that's it and we're not even asking for their


1442
10:04:46,552 --> 10:04:50,160
names so financial info no health no


1443
10:04:50,160 --> 10:04:54,800
messages let's see what messages uh entails in


1444
10:04:54,800 --> 10:04:59,680
here where is it where do you go here messages


1445
10:04:59,680 --> 10:05:03,912
emails no photos and videos audio files files and


1446
10:05:03,912 --> 10:05:07,440
documents um files and docs


1447
10:05:07,440 --> 10:05:10,960
a user's files or documents or any information about a user's files or


1448
10:05:10,960 --> 10:05:15,192
documents for example file names yes because we're storing actually their


1449
10:05:15,192 --> 10:05:20,872
files their notes so app activity no contacts calendar no web browsing no


1450
10:05:20,872 --> 10:05:24,872
app info and performance no device or other identifiers no so let's just then


1451
10:05:24,872 --> 10:05:28,400
press next there and


1452
10:05:28,400 --> 10:05:33,512
not started so let's have a look at start this email


1453
10:05:33,512 --> 10:05:38,720
process in here and we say select all that apply is this data collected shared


1454
10:05:38,720 --> 10:05:44,872
or both it's only collected okay and data collected in this way must


1455
10:05:44,872 --> 10:05:49,760
still be disclosed but will not be shown to users on your store listing


1456
10:05:49,760 --> 10:05:53,832
is this data processed ephemerally process family means that


1457
10:05:53,832 --> 10:05:58,160
the data is only stored in memory and is retained for no longer than necessary so


1458
10:05:58,160 --> 10:06:01,912
no it is it is not stored only in the memory so


1459
10:06:01,912 --> 10:06:05,192
and we say is this data required for your application and in this case i


1460
10:06:05,192 --> 10:06:08,552
believe that we're talking about email address and yes this data is required so


1461
10:06:08,552 --> 10:06:13,272
i'm just going to say yes it's required why is the user data collected it's for


1462
10:06:13,272 --> 10:06:17,512
app functionality okay so um


1463
10:06:17,512 --> 10:06:21,040
use for the setup and management of user accounts actually yeah account


1464
10:06:21,040 --> 10:06:24,720
management so let's just say account management so


1465
10:06:24,720 --> 10:06:27,512
um and then press the save button so now


1466
10:06:27,512 --> 10:06:31,680
we've submitted the email address and while we're why we're using that so


1467
10:06:31,680 --> 10:06:35,120
let's go to personal identifiers now and start that process so we say we are only


1468
10:06:35,120 --> 10:06:39,440
collecting that and because it's a user id and we're not


1469
10:06:39,440 --> 10:06:43,040
processing it ephemerally i think that's how it's pronounced


1470
10:06:43,040 --> 10:06:48,872
and we say the data collection is required and we say um it is used for


1471
10:06:48,872 --> 10:06:52,640
app functionality okay because we're using the user identifier remember when


1472
10:06:52,640 --> 10:06:55,760
we store their notes so it's more for app functionality than it is for


1473
10:06:55,760 --> 10:06:59,040
registration so that's why we do that and that is


1474
10:06:59,040 --> 10:07:03,192
completed now so let's go to files and docs and have a look at this process


1475
10:07:03,192 --> 10:07:06,960
files and docs and say it is only collected but it is not


1476
10:07:06,960 --> 10:07:11,120
shared remember we are not sharing the user's data even though we added that


1477
10:07:11,120 --> 10:07:14,960
sharing sheet for the user to share their own information with someone else


1478
10:07:14,960 --> 10:07:19,680
but then that is their choice it is not something that we are doing okay


1479
10:07:19,680 --> 10:07:23,912
is it then is this data processed ephemerally then we say no and again i


1480
10:07:23,912 --> 10:07:26,320
don't know if that's the correct pronunciation


1481
10:07:26,320 --> 10:07:30,000
and then is this data required for your app and remember we're talking about


1482
10:07:30,000 --> 10:07:35,760
files and docs users can choose whether this data is collected okay


1483
10:07:35,760 --> 10:07:39,832
because it is not something that we force them to do okay


1484
10:07:39,832 --> 10:07:46,160
and why is this data collected then we say it is for


1485
10:07:46,160 --> 10:07:50,080
advertising personalization should i recommend it no account


1486
10:07:50,080 --> 10:07:55,272
management no so it is app functionality we would say and we save it and that's


1487
10:07:55,272 --> 10:07:59,272
it so after you've done that we can just go to the next screen and have a look at


1488
10:07:59,272 --> 10:08:02,320
this how it looks like you can actually read about all the information that you


1489
10:08:02,320 --> 10:08:06,000
entered in here so um and in here you can see at the bottom


1490
10:08:06,000 --> 10:08:10,400
of the screen says provide a link to your privacy policy and and i have


1491
10:08:10,400 --> 10:08:15,912
already a privacy policy so i've um i believe i have it in privacy policy text


1492
10:08:15,912 --> 10:08:21,440
so i'm gonna copy that and go to privacy policy in here actually leave


1493
10:08:21,440 --> 10:08:24,000
and discard stay um


1494
10:08:24,000 --> 10:08:28,160
so we may have to actually provide that privacy policy i haven't yet done that


1495
10:08:28,160 --> 10:08:31,912
but we will have to do that and


1496
10:08:31,912 --> 10:08:36,232
on the privacy policy page so yes we need to we need to actually do that so


1497
10:08:36,232 --> 10:08:40,800
let's go ahead to um i actually don't want let's save this as


1498
10:08:40,800 --> 10:08:44,400
draft and go here and then enter the privacy policy in


1499
10:08:44,400 --> 10:08:48,400
here and i'm just going to say https let's just make sure it's https yes and


1500
10:08:48,400 --> 10:08:52,800
save that okay then i'm going to go back to the dashboard in here where we were


1501
10:08:52,800 --> 10:08:59,592
for data safety we were at the end of this so let's go to uh next um


1502
10:08:59,592 --> 10:09:05,440
next next next at the bottom of this now we have our privacy policy so now we can


1503
10:09:05,440 --> 10:09:08,080
save this and let's see if there's anything that we have to do in order to


1504
10:09:08,080 --> 10:09:12,960
actually submit it so it doesn't seem like it so it is


1505
10:09:12,960 --> 10:09:17,040
saved successfully so if we go back to the dashboard and then have a look at


1506
10:09:17,040 --> 10:09:21,192
our data safety now we should be able to see that it is crossed out so


1507
10:09:21,192 --> 10:09:27,440
that's fantastic so um data safety is done and now we


1508
10:09:27,440 --> 10:09:32,872
have to have a look at this app category and provide contact details okay


1509
10:09:32,872 --> 10:09:37,680
so let's go in here to app category and we say it is an app and it's category


1510
10:09:37,680 --> 10:09:42,160
let's just say utilities if they're if one exists in here


1511
10:09:42,160 --> 10:09:46,960
um let's just say it is a what should we say


1512
10:09:46,960 --> 10:09:52,480
communication education events food house library blah blah medical news


1513
10:09:52,480 --> 10:09:57,272
personalization productivity perhaps okay and then tags let's just say


1514
10:09:57,272 --> 10:10:00,800
um oh this is horrendous okay


1515
10:10:00,800 --> 10:10:07,040
um let's just say a note notebook yeah let's just keep that okay


1516
10:10:07,040 --> 10:10:10,160
and you can choose more tags if you want to


1517
10:10:10,160 --> 10:10:12,960
and after that is done


1518
10:10:12,960 --> 10:10:16,640
let's see store listing contact details and email address i'm just going to say


1519
10:10:16,640 --> 10:10:20,872
support app pixelity.se phone number and i'm going


1520
10:10:20,872 --> 10:10:26,400
to enter some phone number in here okay just a fake phone number for now


1521
10:10:26,400 --> 10:10:31,360
and https pixelity.se external marketing


1522
10:10:31,360 --> 10:10:34,480
and you may choose to advertise your


1523
10:10:34,480 --> 10:10:39,040
application outside of google play if you want to and that's okay perhaps and


1524
10:10:39,040 --> 10:10:43,512
um before i save this i'm going to bring the screen to another screen and


1525
10:10:43,512 --> 10:10:47,440
actually enter my real phone number okay so i'm going to do that here let's see


1526
10:10:47,440 --> 10:10:53,760
if i can manage to do that it doesn't really seem to like the fact


1527
10:10:53,760 --> 10:10:58,160
that i dragged it to another screen now it likes it okay


1528
10:10:58,160 --> 10:11:02,872
so let me see um uh


1529
10:11:02,872 --> 10:11:07,272
it really doesn't like that i'm dragging it to my ipad so i'm gonna bring it to


1530
10:11:07,272 --> 10:11:10,480
my macintosh


1531
10:11:10,720 --> 10:11:15,272
yes and so all i'm doing here is just to enter that information so let me bring


1532
10:11:15,272 --> 10:11:18,552
it up again and then let's see if you can press the


1533
10:11:18,552 --> 10:11:22,320
save button okay so all i did is just move the screen to another


1534
10:11:22,320 --> 10:11:26,232
physical screen enter my real phone number and that was it


1535
10:11:26,232 --> 10:11:28,160
so oops


1536
10:11:28,160 --> 10:11:35,680
stay safe your changes couldn't be saved why not let me go and see if i


1537
10:11:35,680 --> 10:11:39,680
enter a valid oh i entered my phone number incorrectly so i'm just gonna


1538
10:11:39,680 --> 10:11:43,192
save it and scroll to the top of the screen


1539
10:11:43,192 --> 10:11:47,832
bring it back up and then let's go to all apps okay


1540
10:11:47,832 --> 10:11:54,320
oops i want to go back to my app here so in here we're done with the select


1541
10:11:54,320 --> 10:12:00,320
app category so that's fantastic now it's the juicy part we have to set


1542
10:12:00,320 --> 10:12:05,760
up our store listing so um this is also actually going to be quite


1543
10:12:05,760 --> 10:12:11,440
a an important part of the setup process so this may actually take some time but


1544
10:12:11,440 --> 10:12:15,912
that's okay and we're gonna take care of that in due time so now we have to look


1545
10:12:15,912 --> 10:12:19,832
at setting up our store listening and the store listening um is one of the


1546
10:12:19,832 --> 10:12:23,192
absolute core components or and the core things we have to do in order to be able


1547
10:12:23,192 --> 10:12:28,320
to release our applications so let's go to set up your store listing in here and


1548
10:12:28,320 --> 10:12:31,360
let's put a short description and say store


1549
10:12:31,360 --> 10:12:36,160
your notes securely okay and a full description with this


1550
10:12:36,160 --> 10:12:40,400
application and you can store your notes in the


1551
10:12:40,400 --> 10:12:45,680
cloud okay so and also i strongly suggest that you write some proper


1552
10:12:45,680 --> 10:12:49,760
description for these things and it is also very important if you remember that


1553
10:12:49,760 --> 10:12:54,552
we used an icon for our application and that icon we


1554
10:12:54,552 --> 10:13:01,680
brought it from stock io so if you go in here stock io and we use the sticky note


1555
10:13:01,680 --> 10:13:06,400
icon so it is important that in your store description in both ios and


1556
10:13:06,400 --> 10:13:12,232
android you just say um app icon provided by and just give


1557
10:13:12,232 --> 10:13:16,552
some attribution to that okay so it's very very important that you read these


1558
10:13:16,552 --> 10:13:20,872
things and also give attributions where attributions are due


1559
10:13:20,872 --> 10:13:25,912
so now we come to the application icon section and you can see in here that


1560
10:13:25,912 --> 10:13:29,760
says the application icon should be five twelve by five twelve and we don't have


1561
10:13:29,760 --> 10:13:33,040
that unfortunately at the moment what we have is a thousand twenty four by


1562
10:13:33,040 --> 10:13:36,960
thousand twenty four so if we go back to our downloads for instance in here


1563
10:13:36,960 --> 10:13:40,872
you'll see that we downloaded our app icons in one of the earlier chapters and


1564
10:13:40,872 --> 10:13:44,400
we have this app store image in here which i believe is thousand twenty four


1565
10:13:44,400 --> 10:13:47,592
thousand twenty four at the moment so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna duplicate


1566
10:13:47,592 --> 10:13:51,272
this file command d on my macintosh on windows and linux you may have to do


1567
10:13:51,272 --> 10:13:56,000
something else and if you have for instance paint and paint


1568
10:13:56,000 --> 10:14:00,080
plus plus it's called paint.net or something on windows you can also resize


1569
10:14:00,080 --> 10:14:03,360
your image but all you need to do is just in your host operating system you


1570
10:14:03,360 --> 10:14:06,640
need to make sure that this image is 512512 so on the mac i'm just going to


1571
10:14:06,640 --> 10:14:09,360
click on here it open on a separate screen and then


1572
10:14:09,360 --> 10:14:13,120
i'm going to go to tools and say adjust size and i'm just going to say it is 5


1573
10:14:13,120 --> 10:14:17,440
12 5 12 okay these are the guidelines so in here i'm


1574
10:14:17,440 --> 10:14:22,552
just going to drop that file right there okay


1575
10:14:23,592 --> 10:14:28,552
okay so that's for your application icon that's 5 12 5 12.


1576
10:14:28,552 --> 10:14:32,640
now we also need a it's a required feel as you can see it is marked with an


1577
10:14:32,640 --> 10:14:36,080
asterisk in here and it's a future graphing and future graphic is something


1578
10:14:36,080 --> 10:14:40,232
that a google play store can sometimes use in for instance if your application


1579
10:14:40,232 --> 10:14:44,640
is featured on play store um and they are going to use this image in


1580
10:14:44,640 --> 10:14:49,680
order to to basically um do an advertisement for applications so


1581
10:14:49,680 --> 10:14:52,232
there are guidelines for this and it should be you


1582
10:14:52,232 --> 10:14:56,800
can see it should be 1024x500 and since we don't have that we are


1583
10:14:56,800 --> 10:15:01,192
going to use our application icon in order to create that future image so


1584
10:15:01,192 --> 10:15:04,232
what i think we should do is just to open figma perhaps


1585
10:15:04,232 --> 10:15:09,040
and after our figma document is open what we can do in here is to go and


1586
10:15:09,040 --> 10:15:14,640
create a little rectangle which was 1024x500 i believe the guidelines were


1587
10:15:14,640 --> 10:15:18,872
telling us to create it by so 1024 by 500 so i'm going to select this


1588
10:15:18,872 --> 10:15:24,320
rectangle and i say its width is 1024 by and then height is 500 and what i like


1589
10:15:24,320 --> 10:15:29,440
to do is to go my trusty color palette which is from a tokyo night


1590
10:15:29,440 --> 10:15:32,720
let's go to tokyo knight in here in github as we've seen in previous


1591
10:15:32,720 --> 10:15:36,960
chapters i'm going to go scroll down a little bit here and say that i have i


1592
10:15:36,960 --> 10:15:41,680
want the editor background color so it's 2428 3b and then i'm going to copy that


1593
10:15:41,680 --> 10:15:46,552
close the tab come here to figma and change the fill color of this layer to


1594
10:15:46,552 --> 10:15:51,120
that so we're going to use this as our background and what i'm going to do is


1595
10:15:51,120 --> 10:15:56,680
i'm going to go to our downloads folder and grab that app icon png


1596
10:15:56,680 --> 10:16:00,160
1024024 which we've downloaded in one of the previous chapters so i'm gonna bring


1597
10:16:00,160 --> 10:16:03,272
it in here then it is huge i'm gonna hold down the


1598
10:16:03,272 --> 10:16:07,120
shift key and then resize this proportionally so kind of reset it to


1599
10:16:07,120 --> 10:16:10,640
something like this okay so i'm gonna place it in the middle now i'm gonna


1600
10:16:10,640 --> 10:16:15,272
change the name of this to bg change the name of this to icon by double clicking


1601
10:16:15,272 --> 10:16:20,320
on it and then i'm gonna create a text field in here and save my awesome


1602
10:16:20,320 --> 10:16:22,720
notes and let's


1603
10:16:22,720 --> 10:16:27,272
bring these into three separate lines like that and let's also make sure that


1604
10:16:27,272 --> 10:16:32,400
the fill color of this is white also ensure as you can see like mine


1605
10:16:32,400 --> 10:16:37,760
it is right aligned then i'm gonna place it somewhere here okay in the middle as


1606
10:16:37,760 --> 10:16:42,160
well and perhaps we could even increase the size of the font so let's see what


1607
10:16:42,160 --> 10:16:47,440
we have here we have about 200 let's say 120 and it is a little bit bigger a


1608
10:16:47,440 --> 10:16:51,680
little bit bolder in your face kind of stuff so and this is our text so this is


1609
10:16:51,680 --> 10:16:55,680
our text what i'm going to do in here then is i'm going to


1610
10:16:55,680 --> 10:16:59,512
um basically take these like bg icon and


1611
10:16:59,512 --> 10:17:03,440
text and then duplicate this bg in here because this is going to be our mask i'm


1612
10:17:03,440 --> 10:17:06,800
going to grab grab it and bring it at the bottom then i'm going to right click


1613
10:17:06,800 --> 10:17:11,592
it and say use as mask and now it has its own group then i'm going to grab all


1614
10:17:11,592 --> 10:17:15,272
of these three layers and then drag them here and now you can see that that mask


1615
10:17:15,272 --> 10:17:21,040
is basically masking off this entire content so it's masking off our icon as


1616
10:17:21,040 --> 10:17:25,192
well so it looks pretty good to me it's kind of proportional it's nice so then


1617
10:17:25,192 --> 10:17:30,640
you can click on this and then in figma go to the bottom so if


1618
10:17:30,640 --> 10:17:35,832
i change the um in here so you can see better perhaps


1619
10:17:35,832 --> 10:17:41,592
then scroll so make sure your mask group is selected then go to export and then


1620
10:17:41,592 --> 10:17:46,000
we're gonna export it as one x and then that is exported now so now we have our


1621
10:17:46,000 --> 10:17:52,160
image looking like this and it is 1024x500 so we can go to uh


1622
10:17:52,160 --> 10:17:57,272
our play console google play console and right where we have to uh throw this


1623
10:17:57,272 --> 10:18:01,680
feature graphic i'm going to go to downloads and the image that we just


1624
10:18:01,680 --> 10:18:06,960
downloaded which is right here i'm gonna just drop it in there


1625
10:18:07,120 --> 10:18:10,720
so then that is working fine as well and then i'm gonna


1626
10:18:10,720 --> 10:18:15,040
save my changes and something is wrong with our changes some languages have


1627
10:18:15,040 --> 10:18:18,080
errors okay that's probably because we haven't


1628
10:18:18,080 --> 10:18:22,232
really uploaded any screenshots yet and we're gonna take care of that soon so it


1629
10:18:22,232 --> 10:18:25,592
is a little bit um strange that it doesn't let me just let


1630
10:18:25,592 --> 10:18:30,000
me save my changes as a draft i have to save this entire screen and since i


1631
10:18:30,000 --> 10:18:33,440
haven't entered some of the information in the screen which is required it's not


1632
10:18:33,440 --> 10:18:38,000
allowing me to actually save it so but we're gonna take care of that soon so um


1633
10:18:38,000 --> 10:18:41,832
what we need to do in here is to ensure that we're first running our latest


1634
10:18:41,832 --> 10:18:45,272
application on the correct phone as well so


1635
10:18:45,272 --> 10:18:49,040
let's see in here i'm going to bring our source code in here and then i'm going


1636
10:18:49,040 --> 10:18:53,272
to say select the device and then i'm going to choose my android phone all


1637
10:18:53,272 --> 10:18:57,272
right so that's that then i'm going to actually


1638
10:18:57,272 --> 10:19:01,040
grab my android phone let's see if i can do it without causing too much problem


1639
10:19:01,040 --> 10:19:04,480
here on the screen like that


1640
10:19:04,640 --> 10:19:08,800
and authenticated great


1641
10:19:08,800 --> 10:19:11,512
make sure it is connected to wi-fi as well


1642
10:19:11,512 --> 10:19:16,872
fantastic so my android phone is now set up


1643
10:19:16,872 --> 10:19:21,912
and let's then go ahead in our source code let me change some


1644
10:19:21,912 --> 10:19:25,760
screen layout in here in our source code then i'm going to go


1645
10:19:25,760 --> 10:19:34,320
to main dark file if i can spell dart file and in here in our terminal


1646
10:19:34,320 --> 10:19:39,192
i have two terminals so one i usually dedicate here to um


1647
10:19:39,192 --> 10:19:43,680
scr cpy so i'm just going to say scr cpy and that's going to bring up the android


1648
10:19:43,680 --> 10:19:47,912
phone up right there and since we've selected that we can now just say run


1649
10:19:47,912 --> 10:19:51,592
without debugging so the goal in here is to run the application on this


1650
10:19:51,592 --> 10:19:56,872
particular android phone and have sdrcpy take screenshots for us


1651
10:19:56,872 --> 10:20:02,552
as you'll soon see so there's a really good command called adb and adb is like


1652
10:20:02,552 --> 10:20:06,000
the low level and low level android debugger


1653
10:20:06,000 --> 10:20:10,960
and by using adb you can actually communicate with your


1654
10:20:10,960 --> 10:20:14,800
you know for instance your emulators android emulators and your android


1655
10:20:14,800 --> 10:20:18,080
phones as we have here so


1656
10:20:18,080 --> 10:20:23,680
if you don't have adb you will actually have to install it so if i say which adb


1657
10:20:23,680 --> 10:20:28,232
on my computer you can see that it says it's homebrew bin adb basically telling


1658
10:20:28,232 --> 10:20:31,272
you that i've installed adb using homebrew


1659
10:20:31,272 --> 10:20:36,480
if you haven't a if you don't have adb on your computer you may need to install


1660
10:20:36,480 --> 10:20:40,400
it if if what you're also doing is following along with the steps that i'm


1661
10:20:40,400 --> 10:20:44,232
providing you meaning that you're taking trying to take a screenshot with


1662
10:20:44,232 --> 10:20:48,872
from an actual device that is connected to your computer okay so i can see now


1663
10:20:48,872 --> 10:20:53,272
that our application is running in scr cpy looking like this so what we could


1664
10:20:53,272 --> 10:20:57,912
do is to issue the command as you saw so let's just go ahead and say


1665
10:20:57,912 --> 10:21:04,720
um adb exec exec out screen cap key and then we save


1666
10:21:04,720 --> 10:21:10,800
it into for instance file1.png and if i have a look in visual studio


1667
10:21:10,800 --> 10:21:15,832
code you'll soon see now there is a file stored here file1png and that is that


1668
10:21:15,832 --> 10:21:18,800
file with the screenshot of our application


1669
10:21:18,800 --> 10:21:24,160
and then we can go to another screen for instance the i forgot my password screen


1670
10:21:24,160 --> 10:21:29,120
in here and we could also send our keyboard down


1671
10:21:29,120 --> 10:21:32,640
kind of look like this and then we can issue another one


1672
10:21:32,640 --> 10:21:38,400
file to png so that's stored as well let's go to the registration screen and


1673
10:21:38,400 --> 10:21:43,040
send the keyboard down and then let's say file three png and also sending the


1674
10:21:43,040 --> 10:21:48,160
keyboard down or up or leaving it up it is it is a it is a taste thing it is


1675
10:21:48,160 --> 10:21:52,552
completely up to you how you want to do it okay so in here i'm going to go here


1676
10:21:52,552 --> 10:21:58,000
vandal mp and actually log in with a real user


1677
10:21:58,000 --> 10:22:04,232
and go to the main screen of the application i'm gonna take file for png


1678
10:22:04,232 --> 10:22:07,832
and then i'm going to go to one of my notes in here with the keyboard up


1679
10:22:07,832 --> 10:22:11,592
perhaps in this case and then say file five png okay


1680
10:22:11,592 --> 10:22:16,720
and then i'm gonna say open so i'll see all my png files in here then i'm going


1681
10:22:16,720 --> 10:22:21,760
to take those files and bring them to desktop so they're not polluting the


1682
10:22:21,760 --> 10:22:26,720
workspace here in visual studio code let's go back in here and you can see


1683
10:22:26,720 --> 10:22:31,512
that you can just drop drop two phone or tablet screenshots in there


1684
10:22:31,512 --> 10:22:34,872
so let's go ahead to my desktop folder


1685
10:22:34,872 --> 10:22:40,960
where i stored all those screenshots and just drop all those images in here okay


1686
10:22:40,960 --> 10:22:46,160
and i can see them populated here i'm gonna grab the login screen and see if


1687
10:22:46,160 --> 10:22:48,872
it can actually bring it first and unfortunately here it's not allowing me


1688
10:22:48,872 --> 10:22:53,120
to drop things at the right order so unfortunately i have to delete them and


1689
10:22:53,120 --> 10:22:57,832
like drop them at the right order so file one first


1690
10:22:58,000 --> 10:23:02,400
and then i have to upload file too so it is a little bit um strange that it


1691
10:23:02,400 --> 10:23:06,552
doesn't let me re rearrange these images


1692
10:23:06,552 --> 10:23:11,440
but perhaps there is a functionality for that that i don't know about


1693
10:23:11,440 --> 10:23:17,192
so let's then say file four and then we have to upload file five as


1694
10:23:17,192 --> 10:23:21,360
well okay so that's there as well


1695
10:23:21,360 --> 10:23:23,272
um okay


1696
10:23:23,272 --> 10:23:27,592
so that's that then what we need to take care of now is to create a five inch


1697
10:23:27,592 --> 10:23:32,480
tablet and since i don't have a five inch tablet here sitting around as a


1698
10:23:32,480 --> 10:23:38,000
physical device then we have to go and create one so if we look at um here


1699
10:23:38,000 --> 10:23:42,400
visual studio code and go to flutter select device you'll see that there are


1700
10:23:42,400 --> 10:23:45,912
various um basic um


1701
10:23:45,912 --> 10:23:50,320
tablets that i've created with my device manager with


1702
10:23:50,320 --> 10:23:55,040
android studio so if you have android studio you can always open it and


1703
10:23:55,040 --> 10:23:58,160
android studio um oh


1704
10:23:58,160 --> 10:24:04,160
oh it did open it anyway so it's right here you can always go i believe into um


1705
10:24:04,160 --> 10:24:08,960
avd manager which is the virtual device manager and then create your virtual


1706
10:24:08,960 --> 10:24:13,680
device as you can see you need to create a file is this seven inch and a 10.1


1707
10:24:13,680 --> 10:24:18,000
inch tablet because we're going to take screenshots with these so what i'm going


1708
10:24:18,000 --> 10:24:22,960
to do actually is to launch both of these tablets so that they're ready to


1709
10:24:22,960 --> 10:24:28,552
go when we need them so that's the first tablet and i'm actually going to


1710
10:24:28,552 --> 10:24:33,680
turn it around so it is in the portrait mode so that's that one and then i'm


1711
10:24:33,680 --> 10:24:38,872
also going to ask avd manager here to run a second tablet


1712
10:24:38,872 --> 10:24:44,232
in here and that was extremely fast i saw i don't even know how it did that


1713
10:24:44,232 --> 10:24:49,040
how could it run this tablet so fast a little bit scary to be honest so


1714
10:24:49,040 --> 10:24:53,832
now that's sitting there um let's see if it's gonna do its work


1715
10:24:53,832 --> 10:24:58,320
correctly though i can see the seven inch tablet is not doing so well let's


1716
10:24:58,320 --> 10:25:03,760
see if i can close it and i'm gonna say yes close so perhaps i should have i'm


1717
10:25:03,760 --> 10:25:08,160
going to shut this one down and don't know if we're going to


1718
10:25:08,160 --> 10:25:13,912
actually be better off first running the 7-inch tablet and see if that is


1719
10:25:13,912 --> 10:25:16,872
successful maybe something happened in the


1720
10:25:16,872 --> 10:25:21,680
processing of the 10 inch as well as the 7 inch i don't really know


1721
10:25:21,680 --> 10:25:26,000
it is completely up to the device manager here


1722
10:25:26,000 --> 10:25:30,480
and i can see that this device isn't really doing so well so i press the


1723
10:25:30,480 --> 10:25:34,400
power button on it here and i can see now it is running so i'm going to press


1724
10:25:34,400 --> 10:25:38,552
the home button and um orientation isn't really working


1725
10:25:38,552 --> 10:25:42,552
so well here so i can see that


1726
10:25:42,552 --> 10:25:45,832
now maybe it's working a little bit better so let's just leave it at that so


1727
10:25:45,832 --> 10:25:50,400
that's the seven inch display and it is up and running then what i'm going to do


1728
10:25:50,400 --> 10:25:55,440
and the flutter daemon has terminated that's completely fine reload it


1729
10:25:55,440 --> 10:26:00,960
then what we're going to do is to say select device in here


1730
10:26:00,960 --> 10:26:04,800
flutter select the vibe and that's probably because the flutter demon


1731
10:26:04,800 --> 10:26:09,832
actually crashed on us here so i'm gonna try one more time and if it doesn't work


1732
10:26:09,832 --> 10:26:12,960
then i'm going to quit visual studio code so


1733
10:26:12,960 --> 10:26:17,272
let me start visual studio code and fresh


1734
10:26:17,272 --> 10:26:20,552
okay now that visual studio started fresh let's just try again and say


1735
10:26:20,552 --> 10:26:24,400
flutter select device and this time i'm going to choose a 7-inch


1736
10:26:24,400 --> 10:26:29,592
android tablet then i'm going to say run without debugging so let's see if we're


1737
10:26:29,592 --> 10:26:33,512
going to have any success running this application in this tablet


1738
10:26:33,512 --> 10:26:38,320
and if gradle build is working well for us today then it's


1739
10:26:38,320 --> 10:26:42,640
going to allow us to do lse performing stream install failed to install


1740
10:26:42,640 --> 10:26:47,760
launching application and sdk g phone 64 rm64 so there could be some problem with


1741
10:26:47,760 --> 10:26:51,680
this android tablet in here so i'm going to close that


1742
10:26:51,680 --> 10:26:57,440
and i'm going to go back to android studio if i can't find it somewhere here


1743
10:26:57,440 --> 10:27:00,400
let's see android


1744
10:27:00,480 --> 10:27:05,120
studio okay it's running now


1745
10:27:05,120 --> 10:27:09,680
and let's go in here then i'm going to go to avd manager


1746
10:27:09,680 --> 10:27:15,360
and let's have a look if we can close these and kill these two tablets


1747
10:27:15,360 --> 10:27:20,080
completely like that like that and while i'm at it i'm also going to


1748
10:27:20,080 --> 10:27:23,272
kill this one so i don't have any use for that so i'm going to create a new


1749
10:27:23,272 --> 10:27:29,832
virtual device then i'm going to say excuse me a tablet that is nexus 7 and 7


1750
10:27:29,832 --> 10:27:33,120
inch display something like this


1751
10:27:33,120 --> 10:27:38,320
that is fine and it's thousand 200 by nineteen twenty so what is required here


1752
10:27:38,320 --> 10:27:40,720
from us it says uh


1753
10:27:40,720 --> 10:27:45,040
seven inch tablet screenshots okay that's fantastic so it doesn't have


1754
10:27:45,040 --> 10:27:49,832
specific size requirements and then i'm gonna press next on s


1755
10:27:49,832 --> 10:27:54,080
is absolutely fine that is fine as well on portrait and


1756
10:27:54,080 --> 10:27:57,680
then i'm going to say finish then let's see if he can run this


1757
10:27:57,680 --> 10:28:01,360
emulator on this computer


1758
10:28:01,440 --> 10:28:04,872
and if everything goes fine we're going to see the welcome screen here i can see


1759
10:28:04,872 --> 10:28:08,800
google's logo so that's a great sign always and i'm going to keep the screen


1760
10:28:08,800 --> 10:28:13,040
here just in case and while that is doing its work we're


1761
10:28:13,040 --> 10:28:17,360
going to go back to flutter and i can see the emulator is up


1762
10:28:17,360 --> 10:28:21,760
now and i'm going to say select device and i'm going to choose it here let's


1763
10:28:21,760 --> 10:28:26,160
then say run run without debugging and see hopefully this time we have better


1764
10:28:26,160 --> 10:28:31,832
luck in running that application in the given emulator so let's see


1765
10:28:31,832 --> 10:28:36,872
wow that went really fast actually it went surprisingly fast so now it's


1766
10:28:36,872 --> 10:28:40,640
running in there and i can see our application running in the emulator so


1767
10:28:40,640 --> 10:28:46,160
what we need to do in here is to actually take some screenshots so um


1768
10:28:46,160 --> 10:28:50,400
when we need all you see here actually we all have to provide 7-inch tablet


1769
10:28:50,400 --> 10:28:54,960
screenshots and we also have to fix the 10-inch tablet screenshot but what i


1770
10:28:54,960 --> 10:28:58,960
want to mention is depending on the size of the screen at


1771
10:28:58,960 --> 10:29:02,640
the moment you can see everything is working fine there's not a problem you


1772
10:29:02,640 --> 10:29:06,232
can go to register screen i also forgot my password and all of these are working


1773
10:29:06,232 --> 10:29:11,120
quite fine however we have a scrolling problem


1774
10:29:11,120 --> 10:29:14,800
and i can see in here that the seven inch display i've mentioned at the


1775
10:29:14,800 --> 10:29:18,552
bottom of the screen that the seven inch display could actually block the view


1776
10:29:18,552 --> 10:29:23,760
and that could be for instance because um now in in this case is not actually


1777
10:29:23,760 --> 10:29:27,192
blocking the view but if you had a smaller screen it could block the view


1778
10:29:27,192 --> 10:29:31,272
in that this screen as you can see is not scrollable so if you had a smaller


1779
10:29:31,272 --> 10:29:36,480
screen then this keyboard could pop on top of the content that you have in here


1780
10:29:36,480 --> 10:29:40,232
blocking the content so what we need to do before we start taking some


1781
10:29:40,232 --> 10:29:44,720
screenshots from our android um tablet let's go and fix these things up


1782
10:29:44,720 --> 10:29:48,640
let's first go to our verify email view in our application oops i press the


1783
10:29:48,640 --> 10:29:52,800
launch button again by mistake sorry about that i'm going to stop this


1784
10:29:52,800 --> 10:29:59,272
let's go to and verify email view and you'll see in the code that the verify


1785
10:29:59,272 --> 10:30:02,960
email view state at the moment's return is scaffold and it has a column in order


1786
10:30:02,960 --> 10:30:06,080
for this column to be vertically scrollable all you have to do is just


1787
10:30:06,080 --> 10:30:10,552
wrap it with a widget and just say single child


1788
10:30:10,552 --> 10:30:14,720
world view as the notes indicate at the bottom of the screen okay so that's the


1789
10:30:14,720 --> 10:30:20,400
scrolling down for that let's now go to the login view so login view and wrap


1790
10:30:20,400 --> 10:30:26,000
the entire content in here in this column and let's say wrap it with


1791
10:30:26,000 --> 10:30:30,232
a widget okay and i'm going to say single child


1792
10:30:30,232 --> 10:30:35,832
scroll view just like that okay and i changed the screen layout a little


1793
10:30:35,832 --> 10:30:40,800
bit so you see the code better let's then go to our register view as well so


1794
10:30:40,800 --> 10:30:46,000
register view and on top of the screen we have the scaffold and a column so


1795
10:30:46,000 --> 10:30:50,800
let's also in this column say wrap it with a widget of single child scroll


1796
10:30:50,800 --> 10:30:56,800
view alright and last but not least we're gonna go to our forgot password


1797
10:30:56,800 --> 10:31:00,232
view and have a look at how we're creating the screen we have a scaffold


1798
10:31:00,232 --> 10:31:04,232
padding column just like a standard we've done in other places as well wrap


1799
10:31:04,232 --> 10:31:10,080
with widget in a single child scroll view all right so that's that now


1800
10:31:10,080 --> 10:31:13,120
that we've done that we're actually ready to launch this application again


1801
10:31:13,120 --> 10:31:17,360
so select device to nexus and then i'm going to say run without debugging all


1802
10:31:17,360 --> 10:31:22,872
right so what we need to do now is to use adb again the low level debugger for


1803
10:31:22,872 --> 10:31:27,512
android but this time we want to take screenshots of an emulator as you saw in


1804
10:31:27,512 --> 10:31:30,320
the previous uh section when we talked about taking


1805
10:31:30,320 --> 10:31:36,080
screenshots of an actual android phone running in scr cpy we had to use adb as


1806
10:31:36,080 --> 10:31:40,800
well but we didn't have to tell it that it is an emulator as you can see at the


1807
10:31:40,800 --> 10:31:47,040
bottom of the screen now if you specify an e flag to adb then that indicates the


1808
10:31:47,040 --> 10:31:51,592
adb that you want to take a screenshot of an emulator okay so


1809
10:31:51,592 --> 10:31:56,000
here's that device running excuse me our application


1810
10:31:56,000 --> 10:32:00,960
and what we need to do now is to go to command line and let me just do some


1811
10:32:00,960 --> 10:32:05,272
reshuffling on the screen and this is our


1812
10:32:05,272 --> 10:32:11,912
scrcpy and i'm gonna just do some screen shuffling here so get rid of this


1813
10:32:11,912 --> 10:32:15,592
let's go to terminal okay so


1814
10:32:15,592 --> 10:32:19,512
let's issue the command as you can see at the bottom of the screen so


1815
10:32:19,512 --> 10:32:24,552
i'm gonna do like this and uh like that so


1816
10:32:24,552 --> 10:32:31,040
adb exit out but before that i'm just gonna say dash e and screen cap


1817
10:32:31,040 --> 10:32:36,552
e and then let's say file one png all right so


1818
10:32:36,552 --> 10:32:40,400
and if i now go to the project structure i can see there is a file called file


1819
10:32:40,400 --> 10:32:45,832
one png and it is a screenshot from our emulator okay so i'm gonna re


1820
10:32:45,832 --> 10:32:51,040
do the same thing i'm gonna go to forgot my password screen and um let's get up


1821
10:32:51,040 --> 10:32:54,400
and get rid of the keyboard in here and let's remove that space that i just


1822
10:32:54,400 --> 10:32:59,040
entered and then take the second screenshot as file to png


1823
10:32:59,040 --> 10:33:03,360
and then let's go to the login page and the register page get rid of this


1824
10:33:03,360 --> 10:33:08,320
keyboard file free png okay so now that we have


1825
10:33:08,320 --> 10:33:12,720
that oops i'm going to i press the back button i'm going to


1826
10:33:12,720 --> 10:33:18,232
log into our application with my email address and our


1827
10:33:18,232 --> 10:33:22,000
horrible password of foo barb ads now we're in the application let's take a


1828
10:33:22,000 --> 10:33:28,160
fourth screenshot called file for png and in here while this is up with the


1829
10:33:28,160 --> 10:33:31,512
keyboard perhaps as well let's see


1830
10:33:31,512 --> 10:33:37,512
and then take screen shot 5 or file 5 png so now we have 5 screenshots from


1831
10:33:37,512 --> 10:33:40,720
our 7 inch display as well let's


1832
10:33:40,720 --> 10:33:45,512
excuse me let's go and collect those screenshots file one two five and then


1833
10:33:45,512 --> 10:33:50,400
i'm gonna delete the ones on desktop and just cut and paste the ones from


1834
10:33:50,400 --> 10:33:54,800
our application then let's go to um


1835
10:33:54,800 --> 10:33:59,440
our google play console in here in the seven inch display i'm gonna drop these


1836
10:33:59,440 --> 10:34:04,160
one by one so drop the file one in here


1837
10:34:04,160 --> 10:34:08,640
and then let's drop file two right after that and then we can say file three four


1838
10:34:08,640 --> 10:34:13,512
and five so i uh so that you know how um i'm


1839
10:34:13,512 --> 10:34:18,000
thinking about the ordering of the screenshots okay


1840
10:34:18,000 --> 10:34:23,120
so that's file four and then we have file five right there and what we need


1841
10:34:23,120 --> 10:34:27,440
to do is we need to basically do the same thing for as


1842
10:34:27,440 --> 10:34:32,552
a 10 inch display as you can see here it says 10 inch tablet screenshot so let's


1843
10:34:32,552 --> 10:34:36,480
go again now we can close this emulator that is


1844
10:34:36,480 --> 10:34:41,760
right there then we can go back to android studio so if i can find android


1845
10:34:41,760 --> 10:34:46,320
studio here okay let's go to avd manager and in here


1846
10:34:46,320 --> 10:34:49,360
we're going to create a new virtual device in this case it's going gonna say


1847
10:34:49,360 --> 10:34:54,320
tablet and in a nexus 10 is a 10 inch display i'm going to press


1848
10:34:54,320 --> 10:35:00,640
next and then sdk s that's fine as well and just run it ooh landscape not sure


1849
10:35:00,640 --> 10:35:04,480
about that but that's that may be fine but you know


1850
10:35:04,480 --> 10:35:07,832
what i'm actually going to delete it and create a new one because we had some


1851
10:35:07,832 --> 10:35:13,040
problem before with the landscape mode so i'm going to say nexus 10 again next


1852
10:35:13,040 --> 10:35:17,512
next portrait and then finish okay so hopefully this starts it in the portrait


1853
10:35:17,512 --> 10:35:22,000
mode so then i'm gonna press the play button right there and unfortunately it


1854
10:35:22,000 --> 10:35:25,512
started in the landscape mode but that's okay hopefully we're gonna be able to


1855
10:35:25,512 --> 10:35:29,832
rotate it around and i can see now it is running


1856
10:35:29,832 --> 10:35:33,832
hopefully uh so like that


1857
10:35:33,912 --> 10:35:39,760
and we should see now the home screen let's see if we can rotate this uh


1858
10:35:39,760 --> 10:35:44,320
and unfortunately it doesn't actually rotate so i want to see if there's any


1859
10:35:44,320 --> 10:35:48,552
properties in here that allows us to change the display


1860
10:35:48,552 --> 10:35:55,512
from landscape to portrait so snapshots recording settings enabled


1861
10:35:55,512 --> 10:35:59,512
light proxy advanced show window frame


1862
10:35:59,512 --> 10:36:04,320
nope nothing in there that allows us to change this device from


1863
10:36:04,320 --> 10:36:08,800
um directional pad no it doesn't change the


1864
10:36:08,800 --> 10:36:12,720
display from landscape to portrait and i am now


1865
10:36:12,720 --> 10:36:17,680
basically trying anything i can so even if i go to chrome in here for instance


1866
10:36:17,680 --> 10:36:22,640
and say no thanks and then if i rotate this i can see that it's unfortunately


1867
10:36:22,640 --> 10:36:27,592
not rotating the actual application so we might then have to


1868
10:36:27,592 --> 10:36:33,360
take a screenshot in landscape mode so let's see if if you can actually do that


1869
10:36:33,360 --> 10:36:36,640
so if there's anybody out there who knows how to fix this issue i'd be


1870
10:36:36,640 --> 10:36:40,960
grateful to also know because at the moment even doing the


1871
10:36:40,960 --> 10:36:44,232
command right and left it's not listening to my commands it's not


1872
10:36:44,232 --> 10:36:48,320
basically rotating so how about this icon


1873
10:36:48,320 --> 10:36:52,800
um well that didn't help so so much to be honest with you so


1874
10:36:52,800 --> 10:36:57,040
um it didn't really i mean i can go here


1875
10:36:57,040 --> 10:37:01,440
and then here oh now it's portrait okay i did something so i just clicked on a


1876
10:37:01,440 --> 10:37:05,272
little icon on the top left after rotating so it rotated to portrait so


1877
10:37:05,272 --> 10:37:09,040
that was just pure luck let's go to visual studio code and say


1878
10:37:09,040 --> 10:37:13,040
command shift p on a macintosh or ctrl shift p in linux and windows and save


1879
10:37:13,040 --> 10:37:16,800
flash or select device choose our 10 inch display


1880
10:37:16,800 --> 10:37:20,400
then i'm going to say run run without debugging and if


1881
10:37:20,400 --> 10:37:24,720
everything is working correctly and gradle's working in our favor then then


1882
10:37:24,720 --> 10:37:29,192
the gradle task is going to go by really fast and i'm very grateful actually for


1883
10:37:29,192 --> 10:37:32,640
that to be honest so gradle is working a lot better now


1884
10:37:32,640 --> 10:37:38,080
than xcode build process so here's our application and displayed on a 10 inch


1885
10:37:38,080 --> 10:37:42,160
display and let's go ahead and start taking some screenshots so i'm going to


1886
10:37:42,160 --> 10:37:46,400
go to terminal here and then start taking screenshots of


1887
10:37:46,400 --> 10:37:51,832
file one in the login view then let's go to forgot password and say


1888
10:37:51,832 --> 10:37:55,680
file two i'm gonna get rid of the keyboard and take the screenshot without


1889
10:37:55,680 --> 10:37:59,512
the keyboard i'm gonna go here to the register view get rid of the


1890
10:37:59,512 --> 10:38:06,872
keyboard and then say file three so that's that let's not log in with a user


1891
10:38:06,872 --> 10:38:11,760
um like this and say foobar baz log in with that user oh wrong


1892
10:38:11,760 --> 10:38:16,000
credentials okay uh foo barbaz


1893
10:38:16,000 --> 10:38:19,680
login and after logging in we're going to take


1894
10:38:19,680 --> 10:38:23,192
another screenshot which is our screenshot 4 and then we're going to


1895
10:38:23,192 --> 10:38:27,912
take another screenshot with the keyboard and for our um


1896
10:38:27,912 --> 10:38:33,040
file 5. all right so that is also that then i'm going to open


1897
10:38:33,040 --> 10:38:36,872
the current folder i can see five screenshots in here go to my desktop get


1898
10:38:36,872 --> 10:38:40,872
rid of the old ones and paste the new ones in there


1899
10:38:40,872 --> 10:38:44,800
okay now that we have those we can clean and remove this


1900
10:38:44,800 --> 10:38:49,832
emulator we don't have it and i'm also going to close avd i can see it's


1901
10:38:49,832 --> 10:38:55,512
already closed so let's go back to um our play store in here


1902
10:38:55,512 --> 10:39:00,080
so and play store um console so i'm gonna upload


1903
10:39:00,080 --> 10:39:06,160
this new um png file file one then file two for the ten inch tablet so all of


1904
10:39:06,160 --> 10:39:10,080
these five screenshots are for the ten inch tablet


1905
10:39:10,080 --> 10:39:14,960
three and then we're gonna go to four here


1906
10:39:14,960 --> 10:39:19,512
and then last but not least we're gonna upload screenshot five and then right


1907
10:39:19,512 --> 10:39:22,872
after the upload is done i'm just going to delete all those files to keep my


1908
10:39:22,872 --> 10:39:26,640
desktop clean so after doing that let's just then save this and now you can see


1909
10:39:26,640 --> 10:39:31,440
it says your changes have been saved fantastic


1910
10:39:31,440 --> 10:39:37,592
so now that is done and we need to create a release app so if i


1911
10:39:37,592 --> 10:39:42,720
just bring my notes up a little bit here fantastic so


1912
10:39:42,720 --> 10:39:46,320
what we need to do we need to have a look at a little url here as you can see


1913
10:39:46,320 --> 10:39:50,800
at the bottom of the screen it's called docslatter dev deployment android it is


1914
10:39:50,800 --> 10:39:55,040
a very important document and here i strongly suggest anybody who's trying to


1915
10:39:55,040 --> 10:39:59,192
create a release application to go through this it has information for


1916
10:39:59,192 --> 10:40:05,832
windows and macintosh and linux users and these commands are absolutely um


1917
10:40:05,832 --> 10:40:09,512
full of value so you may have to google these otherwise


1918
10:40:09,512 --> 10:40:15,680
around but this document has really put all of that together in the same place


1919
10:40:15,680 --> 10:40:19,360
so as you can see in here the first thing that we need to do is to create a


1920
10:40:19,360 --> 10:40:25,040
signing key for our application and you need to follow these um


1921
10:40:25,040 --> 10:40:30,160
commands in here that have been created for you so you can see and if i bring a


1922
10:40:30,160 --> 10:40:34,080
terminal up so if i say terminal and i'll bring it up here and


1923
10:40:34,080 --> 10:40:40,080
if i go to this folder dot android on my computer like this and i already have


1924
10:40:40,080 --> 10:40:44,800
some keys as you can see in here so i have some keys already set up but in


1925
10:40:44,800 --> 10:40:47,592
order for us to actually um


1926
10:40:47,592 --> 10:40:53,912
be able to follow along with this and guide we need to go and create these


1927
10:40:53,912 --> 10:40:59,440
keys for us as well okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to do


1928
10:40:59,440 --> 10:41:03,040
let's see if i can bring up the command for you as you can see at the bottom of


1929
10:41:03,040 --> 10:41:06,872
the screen so i'm going to actually copy that command that i provided for you at


1930
10:41:06,872 --> 10:41:11,512
the bottom of the screen okay so and i'm going to go to terminal and


1931
10:41:11,512 --> 10:41:16,800
um let's just go to desktop for instance and then i'm going to issue that command


1932
10:41:16,800 --> 10:41:20,320
exactly as you can see at the bottom of the screen so let's see what happens in


1933
10:41:20,320 --> 10:41:24,480
here now it says enter a key store password so this is a password that you


1934
10:41:24,480 --> 10:41:28,640
need to then provide inside a property file i'll tell you soon about it so


1935
10:41:28,640 --> 10:41:32,320
remember this password up until this point for this course we've been using


1936
10:41:32,320 --> 10:41:36,320
foobar baz as a password is an absolutely horrible password so please


1937
10:41:36,320 --> 10:41:40,000
don't use that but since we've used it consistently in this course and since


1938
10:41:40,000 --> 10:41:44,320
the password in this sense has no meaning for this course i'm just going


1939
10:41:44,320 --> 10:41:48,640
to say foo bar pass but please don't use a password as weak as that so


1940
10:41:48,640 --> 10:41:53,120
let's say foo barbaz and let's see what it said java as a


1941
10:41:53,120 --> 10:41:56,960
keystore was tampered with or password was incorrect so


1942
10:41:56,960 --> 10:42:01,912
um it this could perhaps be because i'm actually trying to create an upload key


1943
10:42:01,912 --> 10:42:06,720
store like this and i already have one from before so what i'm going to do is


1944
10:42:06,720 --> 10:42:10,960
to actually delete this file so i'm going to say remove that file okay


1945
10:42:10,960 --> 10:42:15,360
upload keystore like that and i'm going to issue this command again and i'm


1946
10:42:15,360 --> 10:42:20,872
going to say foo bar house and fubarba so if you if you've already


1947
10:42:20,872 --> 10:42:24,872
had a key store from before then you could just use it but i'm assuming that


1948
10:42:24,872 --> 10:42:30,160
you didn't have one however when i did issue this command i already had one so


1949
10:42:30,160 --> 10:42:33,760
chances are you didn't have a keystore from before you didn't you didn't have


1950
10:42:33,760 --> 10:42:37,912
to delete it but in my case i actually have to delete it first and then issue


1951
10:42:37,912 --> 10:42:41,040
the command that you can see in the caption at the bottom of the screen so


1952
10:42:41,040 --> 10:42:44,720
what is your first and last name i'm just going to save and i have andy poor


1953
10:42:44,720 --> 10:42:47,832
okay and your organization unit i'm just


1954
10:42:47,832 --> 10:42:52,480
going to say development and then name of your organization is


1955
10:42:52,480 --> 10:42:58,080
pixelity a b okay city or locality okay i can just say stockholm okay


1956
10:42:58,080 --> 10:43:03,832
and state or okay stockholm again let's see uh two letter country code i'm gonna


1957
10:43:03,832 --> 10:43:09,760
say s e and it is saying is it correct then i'm gonna press the enter button


1958
10:43:09,760 --> 10:43:13,760
uh i've already entered all of that maybe i made a mistake in here so let's


1959
10:43:13,760 --> 10:43:20,080
just say what was the question correct no do i have to type yes i'm


1960
10:43:20,080 --> 10:43:24,232
just going to say yes so you have to provide yes at the end of


1961
10:43:24,232 --> 10:43:29,832
that and then what is the same return if same as keystore password yes just enter


1962
10:43:29,832 --> 10:43:34,552
okay so now it's created a key store for us in here you can see in the


1963
10:43:34,552 --> 10:43:40,960
android folder upload keystore jks okay so that's very very important


1964
10:43:40,960 --> 10:43:44,872
now that that has been created what we need to do is to have if you had


1965
10:43:44,872 --> 10:43:48,800
followed this you can see that what we need to do now is to go to our flutter


1966
10:43:48,800 --> 10:43:52,872
project in here you see it says go to your flutter project


1967
10:43:52,872 --> 10:43:55,512
and and go to the android folder and create


1968
10:43:55,512 --> 10:44:01,832
a file called key dot properties okay so let's go ahead and create that so i'm


1969
10:44:01,832 --> 10:44:06,960
going to open visual studio code in here and then i'm going to go to cd


1970
10:44:06,960 --> 10:44:10,480
and let's see where we are at the moment we're in the


1971
10:44:10,480 --> 10:44:14,320
root folder of our project standard project i'm gonna go to the android


1972
10:44:14,320 --> 10:44:18,400
folder as it was suggested there and then i'm gonna create a new file as it


1973
10:44:18,400 --> 10:44:23,512
was called here key dot properties okay so key dot properties like this and then


1974
10:44:23,512 --> 10:44:26,960
i'm gonna paste that content that was mentioned


1975
10:44:26,960 --> 10:44:30,480
here as you can see like that


1976
10:44:30,480 --> 10:44:34,960
so maybe the entire content so i'm just gonna paste it in here okay so it says


1977
10:44:34,960 --> 10:44:40,000
password for previous step from previous step and we just said fubar bass


1978
10:44:40,000 --> 10:44:45,192
like that and the key password as well and again that is foo bar bass the key


1979
10:44:45,192 --> 10:44:49,040
alias we're going to leave it as upload and in here we're going to say the file


1980
10:44:49,040 --> 10:44:54,720
was stored in let's see if you can get the entire path for this so it's right


1981
10:44:54,720 --> 10:45:01,192
here so i'm going to copy that path path sorry and then i'm going to delete this


1982
10:45:01,192 --> 10:45:05,680
information in here and then paste it right there okay


1983
10:45:05,680 --> 10:45:10,400
so that should be good to go so i'm just gonna double check in my notes as well


1984
10:45:10,400 --> 10:45:14,960
that that is how we've done it before as well and that seems to be completely


1985
10:45:14,960 --> 10:45:18,232
fine so then after doing that with an empty line


1986
10:45:18,232 --> 10:45:23,040
at the end i'm going to close this file and save its contents right there so now


1987
10:45:23,040 --> 10:45:26,800
if you go to the main folder of your application and say git status then you


1988
10:45:26,800 --> 10:45:31,040
should see that you have only these things basically


1989
10:45:31,040 --> 10:45:35,120
committing to your project because your key properties are not going to be


1990
10:45:35,120 --> 10:45:37,760
committed okay so


1991
10:45:37,760 --> 10:45:41,120
and that's that's why i'm mentioning here that you always need to make sure


1992
10:45:41,120 --> 10:45:45,440
that that particular file is not going to be committed with your project into


1993
10:45:45,440 --> 10:45:50,232
github so you could always go to your git ignore file and actually add that


1994
10:45:50,232 --> 10:45:55,192
particular file to your ignore so let's just say veeam git ignore


1995
10:45:55,192 --> 10:46:00,040
not get ignore and in here we're just going to add a new file and say any


1996
10:46:00,040 --> 10:46:04,640
key.properties file should not be committed and then we do a good status


1997
10:46:04,640 --> 10:46:09,120
again that our get ignore is changed if you're paranoid like me you will do it


1998
10:46:09,120 --> 10:46:14,400
like i did all right so after doing that what we need to do


1999
10:46:14,400 --> 10:46:19,120
is to in fact create basically um


2000
10:46:19,120 --> 10:46:23,272
sorry we have to update our build gradle for signing and


2001
10:46:23,272 --> 10:46:30,000
i provide a link which i'm going to go to myself and let's see um


2002
10:46:30,000 --> 10:46:33,592
if i can find that link myself


2003
10:46:33,592 --> 10:46:38,320
configure signing in gradle and that is right here uh here


2004
10:46:38,320 --> 10:46:42,400
and it is telling us exactly what to do it says add the keystore information


2005
10:46:42,400 --> 10:46:46,872
from your properties file before the android block you see this android block


2006
10:46:46,872 --> 10:46:52,480
in here so what we need to do is to go to this file in our project android app


2007
10:46:52,480 --> 10:47:00,080
build gradle so visual studio code let's go to um build.gradle in android


2008
10:47:00,080 --> 10:47:04,160
app all right so we're there and what did it say that we have to find this


2009
10:47:04,160 --> 10:47:08,000
section android you see so let's find the android block right


2010
10:47:08,000 --> 10:47:13,832
there it's just one so right there then let's copy this text as it is mentioned


2011
10:47:13,832 --> 10:47:18,960
there and paste it right before android okay boom and i'm going to bring it one


2012
10:47:18,960 --> 10:47:21,592
step back as well so it is


2013
10:47:21,592 --> 10:47:24,640
um basically formatted correctly okay so


2014
10:47:24,640 --> 10:47:28,872
that's that part and it says then load the key.properties file into the


2015
10:47:28,872 --> 10:47:32,872
keystore properties object and that's what this guy is doing okay then what we


2016
10:47:32,872 --> 10:47:37,272
need to do it says find the build types block so let's go and find that you can


2017
10:47:37,272 --> 10:47:41,760
see the release we're gonna basically edit that as well so i'm gonna go to my


2018
10:47:41,760 --> 10:47:45,592
notes as well build gradle uh sorry about that just to ensure that i'm


2019
10:47:45,592 --> 10:47:50,872
following all the steps correctly and in here it says release to do add


2020
10:47:50,872 --> 10:47:54,080
your own signing config for the release build signing with the debug key for now


2021
10:47:54,080 --> 10:47:59,272
so flutter run release works and it says then replace that with this so you just


2022
10:47:59,272 --> 10:48:04,872
have to grab this information here and just completely replace this build types


2023
10:48:04,872 --> 10:48:09,512
with that thing that was provided i'm gonna fix the uh indentation a little


2024
10:48:09,512 --> 10:48:14,320
bit as well so here the key alias password are being read from the correct


2025
10:48:14,320 --> 10:48:19,760
place and then the release is signed with the release key in here


2026
10:48:19,760 --> 10:48:24,552
and that is it really so you don't have to do so much more and what we're gonna


2027
10:48:24,552 --> 10:48:27,760
do now is to as you can see at the bottom of the screen we're gonna do some


2028
10:48:27,760 --> 10:48:32,400
cleaning up of the um of the build artifact so in your project you need to


2029
10:48:32,400 --> 10:48:37,832
now go to terminal here as you can see for on my screen so i'm just going to go


2030
10:48:37,832 --> 10:48:42,800
and say flutter clean okay


2031
10:48:42,960 --> 10:48:45,760
so like that


2032
10:48:46,640 --> 10:48:51,832
all right and we're then going to say flutter


2033
10:48:51,832 --> 10:48:54,960
pub get


2034
10:48:54,960 --> 10:48:57,512
all right


2035
10:48:59,040 --> 10:49:02,640
and after doing that we're actually going to


2036
10:49:02,640 --> 10:49:07,040
um create our app bundle so after doing flutter pop get then you have to issue


2037
10:49:07,040 --> 10:49:12,320
flutter build app bundle so by issuing this command you can see


2038
10:49:12,320 --> 10:49:16,320
now it is going to start building your application with griddle using all those


2039
10:49:16,320 --> 10:49:19,680
properties that you've specified in those various files so there was a lot


2040
10:49:19,680 --> 10:49:24,000
of work that we have to do but thankfully it's been documented so well


2041
10:49:24,000 --> 10:49:28,640
that it makes the whole process so much easier had it not been for all those


2042
10:49:28,640 --> 10:49:33,192
documentation bits and pieces it would have been such a difficult process to go


2043
10:49:33,192 --> 10:49:38,400
through so let's just wait for this build gradle process to now do its work


2044
10:49:38,400 --> 10:49:41,912
and all right now you can see that the process has gone through it has created


2045
10:49:41,912 --> 10:49:46,640
our little app bundle which is this aab file


2046
10:49:46,640 --> 10:49:50,960
and what we need to do is to be able to then upload this app bundle to google


2047
10:49:50,960 --> 10:49:55,440
play store so let's go back to our play store and here i'm going to close this


2048
10:49:55,440 --> 10:50:00,080
close figma and let's now go back to our dashboard


2049
10:50:00,080 --> 10:50:04,160
in here and you can see my awesome notes and


2050
10:50:04,160 --> 10:50:08,080
let's see what we have going on in here and what we need to do


2051
10:50:08,080 --> 10:50:15,360
is to go to our production in here and and then create a new release okay so


2052
10:50:15,360 --> 10:50:19,272
press the create new new release in there and you can see now it asks you to


2053
10:50:19,272 --> 10:50:23,192
upload your app bundle so what i'm going to do is to go back to visual studio


2054
10:50:23,192 --> 10:50:29,272
code and see where this file is located so i'm going to open that folder and i


2055
10:50:29,272 --> 10:50:34,960
can see the aab here and i'm going to then drag it in here and place it there


2056
10:50:34,960 --> 10:50:37,272
okay


2057
10:50:38,320 --> 10:50:41,760
so after this upload is done it may take


2058
10:50:41,760 --> 10:50:45,192
some time i can see it's 25 megabytes although i'm at a thousand thousand line


2059
10:50:45,192 --> 10:50:49,440
um fiber optic network in here it's taking like a while to upload i don't


2060
10:50:49,440 --> 10:50:52,400
know really why but in the release name as you can see


2061
10:50:52,400 --> 10:50:56,960
it says that well this is not something um that we actually share with anybody


2062
10:50:56,960 --> 10:51:03,120
so let's just say um first we call it first version okay so and in here for


2063
10:51:03,120 --> 10:51:07,120
your release notes you will basically copy from a previous release well we


2064
10:51:07,120 --> 10:51:12,000
don't have that listen here just say um the first


2065
10:51:12,000 --> 10:51:18,320
version of our app okay and then we can save this information


2066
10:51:18,320 --> 10:51:21,592
all right so excuse me


2067
10:51:21,592 --> 10:51:27,760
so now we have that um we have the first version in there okay


2068
10:51:27,760 --> 10:51:30,000
and


2069
10:51:30,320 --> 10:51:33,592
that should be it so let's just go to the review release in here and we have


2070
10:51:33,592 --> 10:51:36,872
one error that's probably because we haven't provided the countries


2071
10:51:36,872 --> 10:51:40,720
and add at least one country or region and that's fine we're gonna we're gonna


2072
10:51:40,720 --> 10:51:46,400
add that so let's go and see overview where we have to add these


2073
10:51:46,400 --> 10:51:49,912
countries if we can't figure it out somehow


2074
10:51:49,912 --> 10:51:56,160
let's click in there android okay that is fine


2075
10:51:56,160 --> 10:52:01,192
and um we need to go to under production and


2076
10:52:01,192 --> 10:52:04,800
all the countries or release as you can see in google play a console under


2077
10:52:04,800 --> 10:52:09,040
production so i believe we're already under production so if i click under


2078
10:52:09,040 --> 10:52:13,272
production now we can see countries and regions so let's go in there and say add


2079
10:52:13,272 --> 10:52:16,320
countries and regions and i believe we could in here


2080
10:52:16,320 --> 10:52:20,400
hopefully select all countries if you


2081
10:52:20,400 --> 10:52:24,080
sell such good make sure your price for the countries well can we not sell oh


2082
10:52:24,080 --> 10:52:28,400
yeah i i saw that if i click here i can select all the


2083
10:52:28,400 --> 10:52:32,800
countries so let's do that and say add countries and regions and then press the


2084
10:52:32,800 --> 10:52:38,080
add button fantastic then we're gonna go to our releases


2085
10:52:38,080 --> 10:52:40,640
and uh here


2086
10:52:40,640 --> 10:52:44,872
we have this release so let's go to the release dashboard


2087
10:52:44,872 --> 10:52:48,400
okay that's fine and then i'm gonna press the edit release


2088
10:52:48,400 --> 10:52:51,832
and i'm gonna press the review release now that we've selected all those


2089
10:52:51,832 --> 10:52:54,640
countries we have one warning the app bundle contains native code and if


2090
10:52:54,640 --> 10:52:57,832
you've not uploaded debug symbols okay and these debug symbols is something


2091
10:52:57,832 --> 10:53:01,680
that i actually encourage you to go read about because these are gonna allow you


2092
10:53:01,680 --> 10:53:07,192
to see when whenever and if there is any crashes in your application occurring


2093
10:53:07,192 --> 10:53:09,592
anywhere where your users are using your


2094
10:53:09,592 --> 10:53:13,440
application so i would really suggest that you do this


2095
10:53:13,440 --> 10:53:16,800
and upload your d box symbols although that's something that i believe is


2096
10:53:16,800 --> 10:53:20,480
outside the scope of this course but it should be quite straightforward for you


2097
10:53:20,480 --> 10:53:24,480
to figure it out and there's link in here that you can read more about it


2098
10:53:24,480 --> 10:53:29,040
so now we can start the rollout to production and then say rollout


2099
10:53:29,040 --> 10:53:33,120
and you'll see now this is going to go in review and


2100
10:53:33,120 --> 10:53:38,160
and google uh cons like at the play console could take some while some time


2101
10:53:38,160 --> 10:53:42,080
to rel to review the first version of our application some people said it


2102
10:53:42,080 --> 10:53:46,320
takes upwards of a week and for me it's some sometimes actually taking about


2103
10:53:46,320 --> 10:53:50,320
eight nine days so depending on what you've done like that


2104
10:53:50,320 --> 10:53:53,760
your track record from before if you release any applications from before you


2105
10:53:53,760 --> 10:53:58,552
may actually be able to be placed somewhere first in the queue or maybe


2106
10:53:58,552 --> 10:54:01,680
last i don't know i don't know their processes so


2107
10:54:01,680 --> 10:54:05,040
um and that that was really in that was like the releasing of our android


2108
10:54:05,040 --> 10:54:08,480
application and we went through quite a lot even figma design in the middle of


2109
10:54:08,480 --> 10:54:12,720
everything so congratulations for going through this together with me


2110
10:54:12,720 --> 10:54:16,400
since we've changed some code let's go ahead and


2111
10:54:16,400 --> 10:54:21,040
um actually commits all our changes so i'm going to say good status


2112
10:54:21,040 --> 10:54:25,040
and make sure that your properties file the key properties file


2113
10:54:25,040 --> 10:54:28,872
is not added so let's just say git add all


2114
10:54:28,872 --> 10:54:32,960
and then i'm going to say git commit step


2115
10:54:32,960 --> 10:54:36,320
31 and if you have a look at our logs we


2116
10:54:36,320 --> 10:54:41,272
have step 30 and 31 so let's push those changes to our remote and then i'm going


2117
10:54:41,272 --> 10:54:46,480
to say get a tag also step 31 okay


2118
10:54:46,480 --> 10:54:51,040
and get push tags so


2119
10:54:51,040 --> 10:54:56,800
that was it now you've released your application for ios and android and um


2120
10:54:56,800 --> 10:55:02,960
this this could perhaps be the last thing that you will um learn about in


2121
10:55:02,960 --> 10:55:07,120
this course right now as it is if you're one of the early adopters of this course


2122
10:55:07,120 --> 10:55:12,232
but i'm planning on putting out a lot more videos that i'm going to append to


2123
10:55:12,232 --> 10:55:18,232
this course with a lot more material so stay tuned and i may actually see you in


2124
10:55:18,232 --> 10:55:22,960
the next chapter hello everyone and welcome to this chapter in the previous


2125
10:55:22,960 --> 10:55:25,760
chapters as you've been following along with this


2126
10:55:25,760 --> 10:55:29,120
course you know that we've created our application and we've also released it


2127
10:55:29,120 --> 10:55:32,800
to the app store for ios and also google's play store


2128
10:55:32,800 --> 10:55:37,120
using a play store console and now you will


2129
10:55:37,120 --> 10:55:41,272
i mean any application or any software is not something that you will do and


2130
10:55:41,272 --> 10:55:45,192
it's just finished every application has to live on and there will be you will


2131
10:55:45,192 --> 10:55:50,552
add new functionalities to it and then um you kind of have to keep it alive


2132
10:55:50,552 --> 10:55:53,592
just as i will keep this course live you'll also have to keep your


2133
10:55:53,592 --> 10:55:56,872
application alive so one of the things that you might want to add to your


2134
10:55:56,872 --> 10:56:01,272
application is localization now um


2135
10:56:01,272 --> 10:56:03,832
if you don't know i mean if you haven't done software


2136
10:56:03,832 --> 10:56:07,040
development before you may not know what localization is but


2137
10:56:07,040 --> 10:56:12,232
localization in um short form is the process of you making your application


2138
10:56:12,232 --> 10:56:16,872
more accessible to other people in different countries


2139
10:56:16,872 --> 10:56:21,360
than the one for instance that um you live in so


2140
10:56:21,360 --> 10:56:24,872
up until this point we've been creating our application with a user interface


2141
10:56:24,872 --> 10:56:29,512
that is mainly in english but you may not be even from england you


2142
10:56:29,512 --> 10:56:34,400
may not be from australia or us you may just speak the language english


2143
10:56:34,400 --> 10:56:39,120
and um for instance i live in sweden so the application that we have developed


2144
10:56:39,120 --> 10:56:43,360
right now isn't really accessible to everyone in sweden


2145
10:56:43,360 --> 10:56:47,680
even though most people in sweden speak very fluent english however it's not


2146
10:56:47,680 --> 10:56:53,192
their mother tongue so localization is um the process of making


2147
10:56:53,192 --> 10:56:56,000
your application more accessible to those people who don't speak the


2148
10:56:56,000 --> 10:56:59,192
language that you've designed for your user interface


2149
10:56:59,192 --> 10:57:04,000
and it's not just about the language and the text that


2150
10:57:04,000 --> 10:57:07,512
you're using it also entails a lot of other and also


2151
10:57:07,512 --> 10:57:10,800
includes many other things for instance how you


2152
10:57:10,800 --> 10:57:14,720
present currency and values in your application


2153
10:57:14,720 --> 10:57:18,320
now we don't have like a shopping basket or anything we don't have an e-commerce


2154
10:57:18,320 --> 10:57:22,232
application and that we've developed so far so there's nothing for the user to


2155
10:57:22,232 --> 10:57:26,000
purchase in the application but um


2156
10:57:26,000 --> 10:57:29,512
if you were developing an application where the user could for instance buy


2157
10:57:29,512 --> 10:57:32,480
things then your shopping basket would need to for


2158
10:57:32,480 --> 10:57:37,272
instance present the amount um for um like the product


2159
10:57:37,272 --> 10:57:41,360
prices in in that person's


2160
10:57:41,360 --> 10:57:46,400
currency so if you're for instance presenting the ui to a person in sweden


2161
10:57:46,400 --> 10:57:49,592
that person doesn't expect to see for instance prices in dollars they would


2162
10:57:49,592 --> 10:57:52,160
expect to see prices in the swedish crown


2163
10:57:52,160 --> 10:57:56,872
and um or if for instance you're doing this application for someone in


2164
10:57:56,872 --> 10:58:01,192
england you'd probably want to do with gbp which is the great


2165
10:58:01,192 --> 10:58:05,440
british pound i think or just pound so


2166
10:58:05,440 --> 10:58:10,080
localization is a lot more than just changing the text of our application but


2167
10:58:10,080 --> 10:58:14,480
since our application doesn't have any of those things we're not presenting any


2168
10:58:14,480 --> 10:58:17,360
dates for instance at the moment we're not presenting


2169
10:58:17,360 --> 10:58:22,400
any currencies or values like that then for us it in it basically means only


2170
10:58:22,400 --> 10:58:27,592
changing the text of our application so what we're going to do in this


2171
10:58:27,592 --> 10:58:31,680
chapter is going to localize our application


2172
10:58:31,680 --> 10:58:34,480
and we're going to do it in two languages so


2173
10:58:34,480 --> 10:58:37,592
for english which we've already done so far which is the text that we've


2174
10:58:37,592 --> 10:58:41,592
provided for the user interface of the application to this point and we're also


2175
10:58:41,592 --> 10:58:44,960
going to do it in swedish now you don't have to know swedish in order to be able


2176
10:58:44,960 --> 10:58:48,160
to go through this chapter i'm going to help you with that and there's a github


2177
10:58:48,160 --> 10:58:51,832
repository for this project that you can just copy and paste


2178
10:58:51,832 --> 10:58:56,320
the swedish text for instance you don't have to even write swedish at


2179
10:58:56,320 --> 10:58:59,360
all you don't even have to follow along writing the exact text that i'm writing


2180
10:58:59,360 --> 10:59:03,040
for instance in swedish you can just put some gibberish in there because


2181
10:59:03,040 --> 10:59:05,760
all you have to do really is just to understand the concepts of what


2182
10:59:05,760 --> 10:59:08,872
localization entails for your application how you can do it with


2183
10:59:08,872 --> 10:59:11,440
flutter and then when it comes to actually localizing your own


2184
10:59:11,440 --> 10:59:16,080
applications then you can for instance choose um bangladeshi or if you want to


2185
10:59:16,080 --> 10:59:21,440
choose any language in india for instance or um or do if in pakistan or


2186
10:59:21,440 --> 10:59:26,400
whatever um language you choose to basically go for


2187
10:59:26,400 --> 10:59:29,040
so you don't have to really know swedish that's what i'm that's what i'm saying


2188
10:59:29,040 --> 10:59:32,000
but um also as you can see at the bottom of


2189
10:59:32,000 --> 10:59:35,512
the screen localization could also be for languages that are not traditionally


2190
10:59:35,512 --> 10:59:40,160
left right like farsi or um arabic so those languages are written


2191
10:59:40,160 --> 10:59:43,440
right to left so there will need to be some special


2192
10:59:43,440 --> 10:59:47,912
considerations made into um code for you if you're trying to support


2193
10:59:47,912 --> 10:59:51,760
right to left languages like for c and um


2194
10:59:51,760 --> 10:59:55,192
so for instance a name of a person um


2195
10:59:55,192 --> 10:59:59,440
you may want to be able for instance if you're presenting a list of famous


2196
10:59:59,440 --> 11:00:02,480
people that for instance the user can read


2197
11:00:02,480 --> 11:00:06,320
about those names may not have to necessarily be


2198
11:00:06,320 --> 11:00:11,360
um presented in arabic names like they're like their spelling doesn't


2199
11:00:11,360 --> 11:00:14,160
necessarily have to be arabic it could be english but


2200
11:00:14,160 --> 11:00:17,912
for instance an age of a person like if you were saying bill gates you could


2201
11:00:17,912 --> 11:00:21,120
write the name in english even though the language of user user interface is


2202
11:00:21,120 --> 11:00:25,192
arabic but the age of that person if you're presenting then it might need to


2203
11:00:25,192 --> 11:00:30,872
be translated in like um numerical values that are under understood by


2204
11:00:30,872 --> 11:00:34,960
whoever speaks that language so um


2205
11:00:34,960 --> 11:00:37,680
what i'm trying to say is that if you're trying to support right-to-left


2206
11:00:37,680 --> 11:00:41,680
languages you may have to take into consideration those points that i just


2207
11:00:41,680 --> 11:00:44,320
mentioned but in this chapter we're not going to do that we're just going to


2208
11:00:44,320 --> 11:00:50,000
cover english and swedish and those both languages are left to right


2209
11:00:50,000 --> 11:00:53,040
now let's have a look at the documentation because the


2210
11:00:53,040 --> 11:00:58,960
documentation for localization of a fluster application is very thorough


2211
11:00:58,960 --> 11:01:03,120
and i highly suggest that after watching this chapter and learning about it


2212
11:01:03,120 --> 11:01:07,512
from my perspective i think it is very very important that you actually have a


2213
11:01:07,512 --> 11:01:11,760
look at the um the official become documentation i'll


2214
11:01:11,760 --> 11:01:18,000
try to open with a tab in here so um i'll bring it to the screen so you'll


2215
11:01:18,000 --> 11:01:21,512
see so i'll get rid of that


2216
11:01:21,512 --> 11:01:24,480
and i'll bring up the


2217
11:01:24,480 --> 11:01:28,872
screen a little bit like this sorry i have to do some rearrangement so you see


2218
11:01:28,872 --> 11:01:34,000
the screen better so as you can see here it's an official documentation for


2219
11:01:34,000 --> 11:01:38,640
accessibility localization and international internationalization


2220
11:01:38,640 --> 11:01:40,400
and um


2221
11:01:40,400 --> 11:01:44,872
you'll see some terms sometimes for instance and during internationalization


2222
11:01:44,872 --> 11:01:50,160
and localization you'll see some terms such as i 18 n


2223
11:01:50,160 --> 11:01:56,800
and sometimes you'll also see l 10 n and you'll be wondering like what are these


2224
11:01:56,800 --> 11:02:03,040
things what does it even mean l 10 n and the reason for like what i 18n


2225
11:02:03,040 --> 11:02:07,040
actually means it is internationalization


2226
11:02:07,040 --> 11:02:12,080
um and if you look at it internationalizes


2227
11:02:12,080 --> 11:02:16,400
if i write it the asian like this


2228
11:02:16,400 --> 11:02:21,440
and then if you take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


2229
11:02:21,440 --> 11:02:26,960
one two three four five six seven eight so 18 total number of characters between


2230
11:02:26,960 --> 11:02:32,720
i and n so it is known then to write i 18 n just


2231
11:02:32,720 --> 11:02:37,272
to refer to internationalization and the same thing is true for


2232
11:02:37,272 --> 11:02:41,512
localization because let's let's bring up for instance visual studio code


2233
11:02:41,512 --> 11:02:45,440
maybe we can actually see in visual studio code a little bit better


2234
11:02:45,440 --> 11:02:48,960
um if i bring it up here and i


2235
11:02:48,960 --> 11:02:54,680
increase the size of the font and if i write enter


2236
11:02:54,680 --> 11:03:00,640
nationalized international international non-lineation


2237
11:03:00,640 --> 11:03:05,832
okay and then write localization so that was one two three four five six seven


2238
11:03:05,832 --> 11:03:12,000
eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight so it's 18 total and if


2239
11:03:12,000 --> 11:03:16,960
we look at localization between l and n if you count it one two three four five


2240
11:03:16,960 --> 11:03:22,040
six seven eight nine ten characters so a lot of people refer to these things as


2241
11:03:22,040 --> 11:03:28,720
i18n and l10n i18n basically means internationalization and l10n means


2242
11:03:28,720 --> 11:03:32,720
localization so now you know the reason for that it's just it's just programmers


2243
11:03:32,720 --> 11:03:37,120
being lazy and trying to like shorten everything as much as they can so now if


2244
11:03:37,120 --> 11:03:41,360
you see these two terms then you know what they refer to


2245
11:03:41,360 --> 11:03:45,832
okay so what i was saying basically in the beginning is to please after


2246
11:03:45,832 --> 11:03:50,000
watching this video go ahead and read the official documentation because it is


2247
11:03:50,000 --> 11:03:53,680
very important it's very thorough it talks about things that we don't even


2248
11:03:53,680 --> 11:03:57,272
talk about in this chapter so um i


2249
11:03:57,272 --> 11:04:01,120
highly recommend that you read this documentation as well


2250
11:04:01,120 --> 11:04:04,720
okay so that was that and now what we need to


2251
11:04:04,720 --> 11:04:09,440
do is to basically get started by adding um internationalization localization


2252
11:04:09,440 --> 11:04:13,592
support to our flutter application so i'm gonna bring bring a visual studio


2253
11:04:13,592 --> 11:04:18,552
code in here and maybe decrease the size a little bit


2254
11:04:18,552 --> 11:04:22,160
i'm gonna change the screen layout all right so


2255
11:04:22,160 --> 11:04:25,192
um this is how we've left our application to this point so what we


2256
11:04:25,192 --> 11:04:28,160
need to do is i'm just gonna close all the tabs and then i'm going to press


2257
11:04:28,160 --> 11:04:33,040
command and command p in visual studio to open a file for instance


2258
11:04:33,040 --> 11:04:37,912
and then we're going to look at our pop spec yaml file so


2259
11:04:37,912 --> 11:04:42,800
if you go there and what we need to do is to add flutter localizations to our


2260
11:04:42,800 --> 11:04:45,760
pop special let's have a look in here and you can


2261
11:04:45,760 --> 11:04:49,120
see and you may be actually wondering why i'm


2262
11:04:49,120 --> 11:04:52,872
what am i even talking about what is flutter um


2263
11:04:52,872 --> 11:04:57,360
localizations and i didn't make that up it is basically documented right here


2264
11:04:57,360 --> 11:05:00,800
let's have a look at it as you can see it says the first thing


2265
11:05:00,800 --> 11:05:04,800
that we need to do is to go to our pop spec yaml file and add flutter


2266
11:05:04,800 --> 11:05:08,872
localizations now what this basically does for our


2267
11:05:08,872 --> 11:05:15,040
application is that it allows our application to be


2268
11:05:15,040 --> 11:05:20,232
localized and it also adds uh like auto-generated code for our application


2269
11:05:20,232 --> 11:05:23,912
as you'll soon see so it is a little bit difficult to explain


2270
11:05:23,912 --> 11:05:27,912
exactly what it does before you've seen the results so what we need to do for


2271
11:05:27,912 --> 11:05:32,800
now is just to find the dependencies section of our pop specky ammo here and


2272
11:05:32,800 --> 11:05:37,040
i found it here and what we need to do in as you can see it says you just need


2273
11:05:37,040 --> 11:05:40,872
to add flutter localizations and i'm going to do that right after flutter


2274
11:05:40,872 --> 11:05:46,232
okay and a column and then we're going to say sdk flutter


2275
11:05:46,232 --> 11:05:50,640
all right so that's that and this application at the moment is not running


2276
11:05:50,640 --> 11:05:55,512
so what i'm gonna do is just to say um select device and then i'm going to


2277
11:05:55,512 --> 11:06:00,872
use my android phone okay as you follow along with the with the course you know


2278
11:06:00,872 --> 11:06:04,800
that i prefer personally to have


2279
11:06:04,800 --> 11:06:10,720
real devices running so right now i have um scr cpy i think somewhere let's see


2280
11:06:10,720 --> 11:06:13,592
if we can bring it up actually let's go to terminal


2281
11:06:13,592 --> 11:06:17,440
scr cpy so this is


2282
11:06:17,440 --> 11:06:21,680
my android telephone and then on the side i also have an


2283
11:06:21,680 --> 11:06:26,320
actual iphone running here so basically there are two devices and that


2284
11:06:26,320 --> 11:06:30,800
have our app installed um so an iphone and an android and we're going to work


2285
11:06:30,800 --> 11:06:33,272
with both of them um


2286
11:06:33,272 --> 11:06:38,960
so um what we're gonna do is to run our application uh on the android phone for


2287
11:06:38,960 --> 11:06:42,400
instance i'm gonna say command shift p on uh when


2288
11:06:42,400 --> 11:06:47,360
on mac and then ctrl shift b on a linux machine or windows and then say select


2289
11:06:47,360 --> 11:06:51,680
device and i'm going to select this android phone then i'm going to go to


2290
11:06:51,680 --> 11:06:57,680
the main dart file and then just say run without debugging so let that do its job


2291
11:06:57,680 --> 11:07:00,960
i'm going to decrease the font a little bit because it's just humongous at the


2292
11:07:00,960 --> 11:07:07,192
moment so after doing that after adding the pop specky ammo in here we also need


2293
11:07:07,192 --> 11:07:11,592
to make sure that we follow the as you can see in here it says yeah you


2294
11:07:11,592 --> 11:07:14,960
have to do these things and we're going to take care of that


2295
11:07:14,960 --> 11:07:18,640
but what we're also going to do is to add this internationalization package to


2296
11:07:18,640 --> 11:07:22,720
our application so let me remove that screen from there make sure that our


2297
11:07:22,720 --> 11:07:26,480
android application is running and this is the state i've left the application


2298
11:07:26,480 --> 11:07:31,120
i'm logged in at the moment so what i'm going to do is just to log out


2299
11:07:31,120 --> 11:07:34,640
all right so that up until this point the only thing we did really was to add


2300
11:07:34,640 --> 11:07:40,400
flutter localization sdk true sorry sdk flutter here then what we need to do is


2301
11:07:40,400 --> 11:07:46,000
to add the internationalization package to our application okay so let's go and


2302
11:07:46,000 --> 11:07:51,120
i'm going to open a new terminal in here in visual studio code and change the


2303
11:07:51,120 --> 11:07:54,400
layout a little bit so you see it better as well like this


2304
11:07:54,400 --> 11:07:58,872
and let's just go ahead and say flutter pop add intel okay


2305
11:07:58,872 --> 11:08:04,080
and you can read more about this intel package on popdev so if we for instance


2306
11:08:04,080 --> 11:08:09,760
go to create a new tab in here and i bring it here and we just say puff.dev


2307
11:08:09,760 --> 11:08:14,320
and let me increase the size to a little bit more ginormous size


2308
11:08:14,320 --> 11:08:20,000
and let's just say intl okay and you can see here's the intl package


2309
11:08:20,000 --> 11:08:24,480
and it is from darkdev so it is actually an official package that you can include


2310
11:08:24,480 --> 11:08:29,120
in your application and there's documentations about how to use it okay


2311
11:08:29,120 --> 11:08:33,512
so you can also see how you can for instance um handle date formatting in


2312
11:08:33,512 --> 11:08:38,080
different languages all right so now we've added that and if i bring this


2313
11:08:38,080 --> 11:08:41,360
screen like this so you can see the results of adding that package to our


2314
11:08:41,360 --> 11:08:46,080
application and i can see it says got dependencies all right so


2315
11:08:46,080 --> 11:08:51,040
that was the result of saying flutter pop at intel


2316
11:08:51,192 --> 11:08:54,480
fantastic the other thing that we need to do is to


2317
11:08:54,480 --> 11:08:59,360
go under flutter here in our pop spec if i change the screen


2318
11:08:59,360 --> 11:09:03,272
layout a little bit more um we need to go as you can see at the


2319
11:09:03,272 --> 11:09:07,512
bottom of the screen we need to add a generate true under the flutter section


2320
11:09:07,512 --> 11:09:14,232
and it is right here so this generates true that we add just like this it is um


2321
11:09:14,232 --> 11:09:17,912
it is very very important basically for how


2322
11:09:17,912 --> 11:09:23,360
code generation is gonna work so i'm gonna basically have a look here


2323
11:09:23,360 --> 11:09:28,960
generate and add space here okay so if you add this generate true in here it


2324
11:09:28,960 --> 11:09:33,040
allows the localization packages and like the localization code that is


2325
11:09:33,040 --> 11:09:38,552
running in your application to generate to auto generate


2326
11:09:38,552 --> 11:09:44,320
code for you what i mean by that is as you'll soon see


2327
11:09:44,320 --> 11:09:53,000
flutter internally uses a file called a file type called marb


2328
11:09:53,360 --> 11:09:57,272
and these arb files are kind of like key value


2329
11:09:57,272 --> 11:10:03,912
files and very i mean kind of like json and in the keys um you specify some


2330
11:10:03,912 --> 11:10:07,192
names for instance you say login screen title


2331
11:10:07,192 --> 11:10:12,000
and the value would then be the actual value you've translated in that specific


2332
11:10:12,000 --> 11:10:14,872
language and you will have multiple of these arb


2333
11:10:14,872 --> 11:10:18,400
files and i think actually i'm going to


2334
11:10:18,400 --> 11:10:23,760
explain it rb more soon but it stands for application resource bundle


2335
11:10:23,760 --> 11:10:26,640
but just know that i mean i don't want to go too much into


2336
11:10:26,640 --> 11:10:29,760
details about arb files right now because there's a section coming up


2337
11:10:29,760 --> 11:10:33,360
where i'll explain that but what you need to know right now is that this


2338
11:10:33,360 --> 11:10:38,640
generate true flag under your flutter section in pop special allows


2339
11:10:38,640 --> 11:10:44,232
the auto generated code to basically hook itself into your project and when


2340
11:10:44,232 --> 11:10:49,040
you add new keys and values to your arb files as you'll soon see how


2341
11:10:49,040 --> 11:10:53,680
then up then the code generation will kick in every time you do a hot restart


2342
11:10:53,680 --> 11:10:58,000
or you run your application fresh and it will go through your arb files and it


2343
11:10:58,000 --> 11:11:00,640
will generate the keys in


2344
11:11:00,640 --> 11:11:04,872
inside like a dart um source code for you


2345
11:11:04,872 --> 11:11:08,080
and this dart source code will be something that you can literally import


2346
11:11:08,080 --> 11:11:12,320
into your application and like use the keys you added to the json as just like


2347
11:11:12,320 --> 11:11:16,800
dart code inside your application so this is a lot of talking just like


2348
11:11:16,800 --> 11:11:20,872
abstract talking but you will soon see exactly how these things work so don't


2349
11:11:20,872 --> 11:11:25,680
worry about that so what we need to do now is after we've


2350
11:11:25,680 --> 11:11:30,480
done all this work we need to basically add support for localization into our


2351
11:11:30,480 --> 11:11:34,800
ios application as you can see at the bottom of the screen in the caption now


2352
11:11:34,800 --> 11:11:40,552
android works just automatically in that when we start adding localization to our


2353
11:11:40,552 --> 11:11:43,832
application new languages the android app just completely understands then


2354
11:11:43,832 --> 11:11:48,320
okay here's a new language i can handle that and i will just refresh my


2355
11:11:48,320 --> 11:11:52,552
ui in order to display all the values that you entered but ios is a little bit


2356
11:11:52,552 --> 11:11:56,160
more old-fashioned you have to help it understand that this application


2357
11:11:56,160 --> 11:12:00,552
actually supports various languages so and i'm actually glad to say that you


2358
11:12:00,552 --> 11:12:04,080
don't have to have xcode in order to go through this particular


2359
11:12:04,080 --> 11:12:07,360
section of this chapter but we need to as you can see at the


2360
11:12:07,360 --> 11:12:12,552
bottom of the screen we have to go to our info plist file and update a special


2361
11:12:12,552 --> 11:12:15,680
section or create a special section called core foundation bundle


2362
11:12:15,680 --> 11:12:21,512
localizations okay so let's go ahead and actually take care of that right now so


2363
11:12:21,512 --> 11:12:24,640
i'm gonna also bring up my notes to ensure that i'm telling you all


2364
11:12:24,640 --> 11:12:30,160
everything that i plan to tell you see if i can find that section


2365
11:12:30,160 --> 11:12:32,640
all right so what i'm going to do in here i'm


2366
11:12:32,640 --> 11:12:36,480
going to close that file i'm also going to close the main dar file and then i'm


2367
11:12:36,480 --> 11:12:40,720
going to press command p in visual studio code and i'm going to look for a


2368
11:12:40,720 --> 11:12:46,000
file called info.plist it should be under the ios folder slash runner and in


2369
11:12:46,000 --> 11:12:50,800
there there's an info p list and if you're curious exactly where that is you


2370
11:12:50,800 --> 11:12:54,640
will be able to for instance go to terminal and i'm gonna clean the


2371
11:12:54,640 --> 11:12:58,872
terminal and i'm just gonna say open you can see this is the folder where


2372
11:12:58,872 --> 11:13:03,192
this entire course source code is based if i say open


2373
11:13:03,192 --> 11:13:06,480
okay so we're gonna open as you can see in here


2374
11:13:06,480 --> 11:13:09,272
so this is the source code where we we are


2375
11:13:09,272 --> 11:13:12,400
at the moment and there is a folder called ios and in there there's a a


2376
11:13:12,400 --> 11:13:16,872
folder called runner and in there there's a file called info plist so


2377
11:13:16,872 --> 11:13:19,592
that's where that's the file that we have to open


2378
11:13:19,592 --> 11:13:22,480
right now okay so i'm going to say command p again and


2379
11:13:22,480 --> 11:13:26,720
then info plist let's open that and these are like key values as you can see


2380
11:13:26,720 --> 11:13:32,160
it's it's a strange like p list kind of like an xml format kind of thing


2381
11:13:32,160 --> 11:13:36,872
but you will need to look for cf bundle localizations in here um


2382
11:13:36,872 --> 11:13:40,552
and if you don't have cf bundle localizations then you'll have to create


2383
11:13:40,552 --> 11:13:45,120
it just like in here so as soon as you see this dict which is dictionary let's


2384
11:13:45,120 --> 11:13:48,960
go ahead and create a new key so let's just say key and we're going to say core


2385
11:13:48,960 --> 11:13:53,040
foundation bundle localizations okay


2386
11:13:53,040 --> 11:13:58,080
and then we end the key right there and what you have to do this the value


2387
11:13:58,080 --> 11:14:02,480
of this key is not just a string but it's actually an array an array meaning


2388
11:14:02,480 --> 11:14:06,872
that is a list of things it's a list of languages or


2389
11:14:06,872 --> 11:14:09,832
localizations that your application supports so


2390
11:14:09,832 --> 11:14:14,232
as you see all the other things in here there they have like these keys and then


2391
11:14:14,232 --> 11:14:17,680
values but for us we have to do something like this you see there's a


2392
11:14:17,680 --> 11:14:22,000
key which is cf um bundle localization and localizations


2393
11:14:22,000 --> 11:14:25,440
and we have to then create an array so let's go up here right after this say


2394
11:14:25,440 --> 11:14:28,640
array and then we close the array just like


2395
11:14:28,640 --> 11:14:32,080
that you see this is how they were doing it here as well


2396
11:14:32,080 --> 11:14:36,080
and then we need to add two strings in here so one string and we close that


2397
11:14:36,080 --> 11:14:39,360
string and another one okay so because we're


2398
11:14:39,360 --> 11:14:44,320
supporting english and swedish so every string in your arraylist is gonna then


2399
11:14:44,320 --> 11:14:47,512
um indicate the language code that your


2400
11:14:47,512 --> 11:14:51,832
application supports okay so first we're gonna support english and then we're


2401
11:14:51,832 --> 11:14:55,680
gonna sweet and support swedish and swedish language code is suv because in


2402
11:14:55,680 --> 11:14:59,832
sweden and sweden itself we don't call the


2403
11:14:59,832 --> 11:15:05,192
country sweden we call it sevaria and that's what that's where sv comes


2404
11:15:05,192 --> 11:15:10,552
from but you can also google this and you can like look for localization


2405
11:15:10,552 --> 11:15:15,120
country codes and you will get to a list on wikipedia or something that tells you


2406
11:15:15,120 --> 11:15:19,272
exactly what you have to use for instance if you want to write um


2407
11:15:19,272 --> 11:15:24,480
a special language in india or pakistan like urdu or whatever you'll have to


2408
11:15:24,480 --> 11:15:30,872
find the correct language code for that so but you can google that easily so um


2409
11:15:30,872 --> 11:15:35,040
i'm not gonna present all those languages code language codes in this


2410
11:15:35,040 --> 11:15:40,080
chapter but i'm just giving you the tools necessary to find out on your own


2411
11:15:40,080 --> 11:15:44,400
okay and that is it really that's all we have to do for the ios app so we've


2412
11:15:44,400 --> 11:15:49,440
added the cf bundle localizations in here and we're good to go for the info p


2413
11:15:49,440 --> 11:15:53,760
list then what we need to do in here is we


2414
11:15:53,760 --> 11:15:58,640
need to go into our root folder of our application and then we need to add a


2415
11:15:58,640 --> 11:16:02,080
file as you can see on the bottom of the screen called l10n and as i told you


2416
11:16:02,080 --> 11:16:07,192
this l10n is a it means a localization that's the 10


2417
11:16:07,192 --> 11:16:11,760
thing meaning that there's 10 letters between l and n in localization so let's


2418
11:16:11,760 --> 11:16:16,800
go ahead in here and i'm just going to right click on this folder in here and


2419
11:16:16,800 --> 11:16:20,160
actually here and then let's add a new file and call


2420
11:16:20,160 --> 11:16:23,192
it lpn yamo all right and


2421
11:16:23,192 --> 11:16:27,440
in here then we have to write some stuff and i'll bring the official


2422
11:16:27,440 --> 11:16:31,192
documentation because it is very very helpful in this case so let's go and


2423
11:16:31,192 --> 11:16:35,440
have a look at the documentation what we have to enter in this ltn file


2424
11:16:35,440 --> 11:16:41,360
let's see if we can find it somewhere and it is an arb file so l10n


2425
11:16:41,360 --> 11:16:45,272
and it looks like this so this is this is like the contents that we kind of


2426
11:16:45,272 --> 11:16:51,040
need to place in our l10 file so as you can see it says


2427
11:16:51,040 --> 11:16:55,832
arb directory and it's called lib el tenen all right and we'll soon have a


2428
11:16:55,832 --> 11:17:00,232
look at what this actually means excuse me


2429
11:17:00,232 --> 11:17:04,872
and then we have something called a template arb file and then something


2430
11:17:04,872 --> 11:17:09,760
called an output localization file okay so um i'm going to explain to you what


2431
11:17:09,760 --> 11:17:13,592
this what these all actually mean so


2432
11:17:13,592 --> 11:17:17,272
what what this arb directory means is it is


2433
11:17:17,272 --> 11:17:22,552
an indication for you you're telling um flutters auto generated localization


2434
11:17:22,552 --> 11:17:25,512
engine where to find your


2435
11:17:25,512 --> 11:17:28,800
files where to find your localizations you see


2436
11:17:28,800 --> 11:17:32,400
when you create localizations for a new language then you have to create a an


2437
11:17:32,400 --> 11:17:36,960
arb file so and you're basically telling dart in this case or flutter in this


2438
11:17:36,960 --> 11:17:41,192
case that these arb files i'm going to create are going to reside under this


2439
11:17:41,192 --> 11:17:46,400
folder so if you look at visual studio code here we have now a folder from all


2440
11:17:46,400 --> 11:17:50,400
when we created basically our project which was called lib as you can see in


2441
11:17:50,400 --> 11:17:53,040
here okay so


2442
11:17:53,040 --> 11:17:59,272
in this lib then we're going to create a folder as it's indicated in here called


2443
11:17:59,272 --> 11:18:03,760
l10n well you don't actually have to call it altenent and that's why you have


2444
11:18:03,760 --> 11:18:08,800
this configuration so you could call it something else you could call it


2445
11:18:08,800 --> 11:18:13,760
localization if you want to or my strings whatever you want to it's just


2446
11:18:13,760 --> 11:18:17,512
an indication to flutter and the localization engine where you're


2447
11:18:17,512 --> 11:18:21,120
replacing those files okay so that's that so that's you're telling


2448
11:18:21,120 --> 11:18:26,552
dart where it f it where to find your localization information then in here


2449
11:18:26,552 --> 11:18:31,680
the template arv file is a file in that directory that you're


2450
11:18:31,680 --> 11:18:36,960
basically choosing as the main language of the application so if for instance it


2451
11:18:36,960 --> 11:18:40,872
can't find a key for swedish in the swedish file arb file it's going to fall


2452
11:18:40,872 --> 11:18:46,000
back to the english one and this is like setting the ground for or setting the


2453
11:18:46,000 --> 11:18:49,592
foundation for how you're localizing your application


2454
11:18:49,592 --> 11:18:53,272
you can think of it as the default language that your application supports


2455
11:18:53,272 --> 11:18:56,320
in our case that language is going to be english so we're going to leave this


2456
11:18:56,320 --> 11:19:02,960
file name as it is indicated here the other thing output localization file


2457
11:19:02,960 --> 11:19:09,512
it is a file for that auto generation to basically create for you so as you'll


2458
11:19:09,512 --> 11:19:14,960
soon see auto generation is very special i mean it's very magic


2459
11:19:14,960 --> 11:19:19,592
so um but you have some control over it and this is like one of those things


2460
11:19:19,592 --> 11:19:22,640
that you can control you can actually control where that auto generated dart


2461
11:19:22,640 --> 11:19:27,192
code is going to be generated and in like what file name


2462
11:19:27,192 --> 11:19:30,640
it is a little bit abstract so i'm not going to go too much into it and you'll


2463
11:19:30,640 --> 11:19:34,480
soon see how we can configure this and what this actually means so what we need


2464
11:19:34,480 --> 11:19:38,080
to do in this internationalization documentation let's just copy this


2465
11:19:38,080 --> 11:19:42,232
content and i'm going to then go in this l10 and


2466
11:19:42,232 --> 11:19:46,720
yaml file that we created and just paste it there okay


2467
11:19:46,720 --> 11:19:51,512
what we need to do in here we're going to leave the arb directory directory as


2468
11:19:51,512 --> 11:19:55,040
lib l10 because that kind of makes sense okay


2469
11:19:55,040 --> 11:20:00,320
uh but in here app instead of app ian i'm just going to say intel yeah it's


2470
11:20:00,320 --> 11:20:04,080
just for me it makes more sense to use


2471
11:20:04,080 --> 11:20:10,720
the intl underscore en as the default file so we're going to create intl en


2472
11:20:10,720 --> 11:20:15,832
and then intl sv for swedish okay and then we're just


2473
11:20:15,832 --> 11:20:19,512
going to leave this as it is so i'm just going to save this file right there and


2474
11:20:19,512 --> 11:20:24,232
then what we can do is just to do a hot restart


2475
11:20:24,232 --> 11:20:27,832
now remember hot restarting is something in internationalization it's very


2476
11:20:27,832 --> 11:20:32,872
important flutter because hot reload won't trigger auto generation of your


2477
11:20:32,872 --> 11:20:36,552
internationalization code meaning that if you have some


2478
11:20:36,552 --> 11:20:40,640
if you've added some new strings for instance to your arb files as we'll talk


2479
11:20:40,640 --> 11:20:46,160
about it soon those things won't be auto injected and generated into your code


2480
11:20:46,160 --> 11:20:50,960
until you do a hot restart hot reload won't cut it so you have to either do a


2481
11:20:50,960 --> 11:20:54,960
hot restart or just completely stop the application and build it from scratch


2482
11:20:54,960 --> 11:20:59,440
and that's a huge overhead so you may not want to do that but a hot restart is


2483
11:20:59,440 --> 11:21:05,592
necessary for that okay so let's have a look now at um


2484
11:21:05,592 --> 11:21:09,272
what arb files are as i mentioned before now


2485
11:21:09,272 --> 11:21:14,000
arb files are application resource bundles and they're pretty much json


2486
11:21:14,000 --> 11:21:20,232
files they are key values in there and your keys are basically how a handle for


2487
11:21:20,232 --> 11:21:24,080
your application to then reach into your localization and grab for instance a


2488
11:21:24,080 --> 11:21:28,160
string and the values of those keys are the actual strings that will be


2489
11:21:28,160 --> 11:21:32,872
displayed in your user interface they are more than just key values


2490
11:21:32,872 --> 11:21:36,800
because you can actually put logic in your arb files in that for instance as


2491
11:21:36,800 --> 11:21:40,552
you soon see inside this screen let me bring it up in


2492
11:21:40,552 --> 11:21:45,832
scr cpy and if you log in with a valid user in here


2493
11:21:45,832 --> 11:21:50,080
and we have foobarbas as our password i think


2494
11:21:50,080 --> 11:21:52,960
um in this screen at the moment on the top of the screen we're seeing your


2495
11:21:52,960 --> 11:21:56,320
notes but what we're going to do in this chapter just to demonstrate how arp


2496
11:21:56,320 --> 11:22:00,160
files work we're gonna say if you have one note


2497
11:22:00,160 --> 11:22:05,360
it's just gonna write no you have one note something like that or


2498
11:22:05,360 --> 11:22:08,000
one note if you have more than one note then it's


2499
11:22:08,000 --> 11:22:13,512
gonna say for instance if you have three notes it's gonna say three notes


2500
11:22:13,512 --> 11:22:17,760
or if you have zero notes no notes at all it's gonna say


2501
11:22:17,760 --> 11:22:22,320
you have no notes so for the same title


2502
11:22:22,320 --> 11:22:26,480
which is the title on top of the screen we can actually put logic into the arb


2503
11:22:26,480 --> 11:22:31,680
file to say hey this isn't a title however i wanted to


2504
11:22:31,680 --> 11:22:36,232
say this if this particular count is zero i


2505
11:22:36,232 --> 11:22:40,480
wanted to say you have no notes if the account is one i want it to say


2506
11:22:40,480 --> 11:22:45,440
you have one note or if the count is more than one i wanted to say you have


2507
11:22:45,440 --> 11:22:48,800
x amount of notes and that x is the actual


2508
11:22:48,800 --> 11:22:53,592
number that we will provide to it so rb files are more than just json they


2509
11:22:53,592 --> 11:22:57,680
can actually have logic in them and they stand as you can see at the bottom of


2510
11:22:57,680 --> 11:23:02,080
the screen they stand for application resource bundle


2511
11:23:02,552 --> 11:23:09,040
all right and now what we need to do is to actually go and create these um files


2512
11:23:09,040 --> 11:23:15,040
so let's go into this lib folder and let's go and create our the folder


2513
11:23:15,040 --> 11:23:19,912
that we mentioned in this l10 and you see we said that under lib we're gonna


2514
11:23:19,912 --> 11:23:25,832
have a folder called l10n and under that l10n we're gonna have a file called intl


2515
11:23:25,832 --> 11:23:30,960
en arb okay so let's go ahead and see if we can get that to work so in lib let's


2516
11:23:30,960 --> 11:23:36,640
go and say new file and then i'm going to say l10n slash


2517
11:23:36,640 --> 11:23:40,720
intl en arb and you can see that it creates the


2518
11:23:40,720 --> 11:23:46,720
folder as well lib l10n and intl enarb and that is the file that we said we're


2519
11:23:46,720 --> 11:23:50,000
going to create here let's then go ahead and say new file


2520
11:23:50,000 --> 11:23:56,400
intl and then we're going to say sv arv okay


2521
11:23:56,400 --> 11:24:01,192
and as i mentioned before these are very simple jsons to begin with so we can


2522
11:24:01,192 --> 11:24:04,960
just create a json for instance here and in the english one first


2523
11:24:04,960 --> 11:24:08,640
so like this and in here i'm just going to say my title


2524
11:24:08,640 --> 11:24:15,040
and then a value of my title goes here okay and let's just copy and paste this


2525
11:24:15,040 --> 11:24:18,640
in the swedish one as well just for now okay


2526
11:24:18,640 --> 11:24:22,640
so and i'm just going to do a hot restart


2527
11:24:22,640 --> 11:24:28,640
all right so what this all did since we've added our auto generation


2528
11:24:28,640 --> 11:24:32,872
in our pop speaking ammo if you remember from before we added this generate true


2529
11:24:32,872 --> 11:24:38,000
inside here now what you should be able to do is to have a look at the structure


2530
11:24:38,000 --> 11:24:40,872
of your project and now all of a sudden you should be able to see a folder


2531
11:24:40,872 --> 11:24:44,872
called dot dart tool and if you drill down in there you should be able to see


2532
11:24:44,872 --> 11:24:48,640
something called a flutter gen and if you drill down in there you'll see gen


2533
11:24:48,640 --> 11:24:55,040
l10n and in there you'll see now three files app localizations app localization


2534
11:24:55,040 --> 11:25:01,040
sv and applicalizations en now what is this app localizations well if


2535
11:25:01,040 --> 11:25:08,080
you remember from our um l10n we actually told the generation to


2536
11:25:08,080 --> 11:25:12,720
generate generated code to be named app localizations and that's


2537
11:25:12,720 --> 11:25:17,760
basically it that's that file we said that it needs to be called that so we


2538
11:25:17,760 --> 11:25:22,232
can open that and you'll see now there's some information in here and


2539
11:25:22,232 --> 11:25:26,080
there is a locale name for instance and then there are some delegate stuff and


2540
11:25:26,080 --> 11:25:30,960
i'll explain all these but what you'll see here now is something called my


2541
11:25:30,960 --> 11:25:36,400
title and is a string and this is exactly what we wrote in this my title


2542
11:25:36,400 --> 11:25:41,192
my title goes here and you can see then if you go to the


2543
11:25:41,192 --> 11:25:45,832
english one your string is there my title goes here


2544
11:25:45,832 --> 11:25:50,320
and the swedish one is also saying my title goes here so it's not so it's not


2545
11:25:50,320 --> 11:25:54,232
so impressive since we actually chose to have the exact same string in the


2546
11:25:54,232 --> 11:25:59,272
english and the swedish version so what we could do is to go to the english one


2547
11:25:59,272 --> 11:26:03,912
in this intel en arb and put eng at the end of


2548
11:26:03,912 --> 11:26:09,040
it and go to the swedish one and say swe like in sweden


2549
11:26:09,040 --> 11:26:15,272
okay and then i now get a a save on this file and then if you go in here you'll


2550
11:26:15,272 --> 11:26:18,872
see nothing has changed and that's what i meant hot


2551
11:26:18,872 --> 11:26:23,912
reload doesn't cut it you have to do a hot restart and if you do a hot restart


2552
11:26:23,912 --> 11:26:29,360
then this code should basically get updated let's go ahead and see if it did


2553
11:26:29,360 --> 11:26:33,760
you can see here's the english one oops i didn't mean to change it and here's


2554
11:26:33,760 --> 11:26:38,160
the swedish one so now you know what those things actually


2555
11:26:38,160 --> 11:26:41,912
stand for and


2556
11:26:41,912 --> 11:26:48,320
we now have a really good ground to stand on because we've created our


2557
11:26:48,320 --> 11:26:54,000
localization yaml a configuration file we have our english and swedish


2558
11:26:54,000 --> 11:26:58,872
localization files right here in lib if you have a look here lib


2559
11:26:58,872 --> 11:27:05,360
ltn and under those we have intel en and intel sv which means intel


2560
11:27:05,360 --> 11:27:09,120
internationalization english and international nationalization swedish


2561
11:27:09,120 --> 11:27:15,272
now all we really have to do is to basically go ahead now and start


2562
11:27:15,272 --> 11:27:21,192
populating these um strings in our application and um kind


2563
11:27:21,192 --> 11:27:24,080
of sorry populating them in the in these


2564
11:27:24,080 --> 11:27:27,680
arb files and then where in our application we have


2565
11:27:27,680 --> 11:27:33,192
text hard-coded then we're going to switch to using these


2566
11:27:33,192 --> 11:27:37,440
strings which are in our l10n file


2567
11:27:37,440 --> 11:27:42,800
and in order for our application to actually understand what


2568
11:27:42,800 --> 11:27:48,080
we have localized in inside our arb files we have to actually tell the


2569
11:27:48,080 --> 11:27:53,040
application which locales we support and in order to


2570
11:27:53,040 --> 11:27:57,192
mention sorry in order to explain that we have to go back to the main dart file


2571
11:27:57,192 --> 11:27:59,680
so let's go to main dart file and have a


2572
11:27:59,680 --> 11:28:03,592
look at how we've created our application and you can see we have this


2573
11:28:03,592 --> 11:28:07,760
code right here that at the moment says run app and then we're creating a


2574
11:28:07,760 --> 11:28:12,552
material application and there are two important properties


2575
11:28:12,552 --> 11:28:16,640
in the creation of material app which we haven't used so far because in the


2576
11:28:16,640 --> 11:28:21,272
previous chapters we haven't done any localization of the application so far


2577
11:28:21,272 --> 11:28:25,832
so these two properties are namely localizations delegate and supported


2578
11:28:25,832 --> 11:28:29,512
locales so let me bring up the caption for this


2579
11:28:29,512 --> 11:28:34,872
section um the way flutter localization communicates with the ios app and


2580
11:28:34,872 --> 11:28:39,440
android app or for instance a web application or desktop whatever you're


2581
11:28:39,440 --> 11:28:44,552
running flatter on it needs to tell the underlying operating system what locales


2582
11:28:44,552 --> 11:28:48,640
and it's supporting so basically that's telling your


2583
11:28:48,640 --> 11:28:54,160
material application which languages your application is built to work with


2584
11:28:54,160 --> 11:29:00,160
so that's the locale so you could say swedish english persian and arabic or


2585
11:29:00,160 --> 11:29:05,120
what have you so those are the locales but you also have the concept of


2586
11:29:05,120 --> 11:29:09,760
localization of your widgets you see at the moment we've created some


2587
11:29:09,760 --> 11:29:14,640
strings and and also we're then gonna soon go and place those strings on our


2588
11:29:14,640 --> 11:29:18,960
ui but also flutter itself has localization support for various


2589
11:29:18,960 --> 11:29:22,800
languages there are so many languages that flutter at the moment supports and


2590
11:29:22,800 --> 11:29:27,760
it can internally also localize its own widgets for instance if you bring up a


2591
11:29:27,760 --> 11:29:31,912
date picker for instance in your flutter application for user to select the date


2592
11:29:31,912 --> 11:29:36,232
that day picker itself can have localization based on the system's


2593
11:29:36,232 --> 11:29:39,680
language or your application's language so if you've chosen arabic career


2594
11:29:39,680 --> 11:29:43,040
applications language versus at the os level


2595
11:29:43,040 --> 11:29:46,640
then and if you bring up a date picker then that date picker is going to be


2596
11:29:46,640 --> 11:29:51,440
localized for that language by default by the flutter team so


2597
11:29:51,440 --> 11:29:55,440
you need to tell material app both about the locales that your application


2598
11:29:55,440 --> 11:30:01,040
supports also how it should localize for instance internal widgets and also your


2599
11:30:01,040 --> 11:30:05,592
custom widgets so what we need to do is to actually go and


2600
11:30:05,592 --> 11:30:11,440
add these two properties here and what we want to do is to refer to


2601
11:30:11,440 --> 11:30:15,440
this app localization file so if you go to dart tools and you can see there's


2602
11:30:15,440 --> 11:30:19,832
this app localizations right here and you can see there is a pop speaking


2603
11:30:19,832 --> 11:30:24,480
ammo and and then this is basically a package so it is a package that was


2604
11:30:24,480 --> 11:30:28,720
created for you you haven't done anything it's just generated for you so


2605
11:30:28,720 --> 11:30:33,912
how do we go ahead and import this in our application and that is by going to


2606
11:30:33,912 --> 11:30:38,000
the top of your main file for instance and say import and then you say package


2607
11:30:38,000 --> 11:30:41,120
and then in here we just say flutter underscore gen


2608
11:30:41,120 --> 11:30:45,512
and this is like the generated code for you and then gen l10n and in there


2609
11:30:45,512 --> 11:30:48,552
you'll see that there is applicabilization's dark files so i need


2610
11:30:48,552 --> 11:30:52,480
you to please go ahead and import this file into your


2611
11:30:52,480 --> 11:30:56,552
main dart file after having done that we need to go to


2612
11:30:56,552 --> 11:31:01,512
the material app and right before we do anything else we're first going to say


2613
11:31:01,512 --> 11:31:06,552
supported locales this is a property and that allows us to tell flutter which


2614
11:31:06,552 --> 11:31:11,192
lookouts our application supports now you may be wondering okay what data


2615
11:31:11,192 --> 11:31:15,272
type this is this is actually a list as you can see it's an iterable of locale


2616
11:31:15,272 --> 11:31:19,040
and some people go and incorrectly create a custom list of accounts and


2617
11:31:19,040 --> 11:31:22,480
then put that in here but you don't have to do that and i actually suggest that


2618
11:31:22,480 --> 11:31:26,000
you don't do that even if you can because if you go inside this


2619
11:31:26,000 --> 11:31:30,552
applicalization start file you see that something down here


2620
11:31:30,552 --> 11:31:33,760
it is created for you calls supported locales


2621
11:31:33,760 --> 11:31:37,192
so it is already understanding what locales your application supports based


2622
11:31:37,192 --> 11:31:42,080
on the arb files that you've provided to um flutter gen so


2623
11:31:42,080 --> 11:31:47,680
please don't go and create the same list in your main dart file in here what


2624
11:31:47,680 --> 11:31:51,040
you'll need to do is just to say applicalizations


2625
11:31:51,040 --> 11:31:56,080
and then you just say supported locales okay so this goes and uses your arb


2626
11:31:56,080 --> 11:32:01,360
files as like a guide let's see lib ltn and ar b fast it just knows that


2627
11:32:01,360 --> 11:32:04,480
you're supporting english and swedish at this point okay


2628
11:32:04,480 --> 11:32:07,512
so that's the first thing that we have to do the other thing that we have to do


2629
11:32:07,512 --> 11:32:12,960
in here is just to say it's called localizations delegates as


2630
11:32:12,960 --> 11:32:16,720
you can see it says the delegates for this apps localizations widget


2631
11:32:16,720 --> 11:32:20,480
and this is basically a way for you to tell flutter that hey i


2632
11:32:20,480 --> 11:32:24,320
support for instance swedish and english please localize your own widgets as well


2633
11:32:24,320 --> 11:32:28,160
so in here you don't have to create custom delegates because those are also


2634
11:32:28,160 --> 11:32:32,480
provided inside your applicalizations so if you go in there you'll see


2635
11:32:32,480 --> 11:32:38,080
something in here localizations delegates all right so


2636
11:32:38,080 --> 11:32:42,592
what we need to do now is just to say applicalizations


2637
11:32:43,272 --> 11:32:47,680
localize app localizations


2638
11:32:47,680 --> 11:32:52,320
and then localizations delegates so then that is provided and i'm going to do a


2639
11:32:52,320 --> 11:32:56,640
hot restart just because we've changed the main function in our application and


2640
11:32:56,640 --> 11:33:01,192
those changes aren't going to take effect until you do a hot restart okay


2641
11:33:01,192 --> 11:33:05,120
and what we can do now is to go ahead and test these changes


2642
11:33:05,120 --> 11:33:09,120
and um what would be really great is actually


2643
11:33:09,120 --> 11:33:14,400
if you could extract that little title that we've written in our intel en arb


2644
11:33:14,400 --> 11:33:18,160
and and put it somewhere on some sort of widget just to see that it is working in


2645
11:33:18,160 --> 11:33:21,680
english and in swedish so what i'm going to do is i'm going to bring scr cpy on


2646
11:33:21,680 --> 11:33:24,720
the screen right here at the moment you can see


2647
11:33:24,720 --> 11:33:29,680
we're on the login page so let's go to the login page and you don't have to do


2648
11:33:29,680 --> 11:33:34,552
this so i'm just going to do this myself just to demonstrate something and while


2649
11:33:34,552 --> 11:33:39,512
we're in the login page let's also clean up these two unused imports okay and


2650
11:33:39,512 --> 11:33:44,000
let's go ahead into our code here to the login and you can see there's a cons


2651
11:33:44,000 --> 11:33:49,120
text login but in here we want to use that title and again you don't have to


2652
11:33:49,120 --> 11:33:52,640
do this and i actually suggest you don't do it it's just for me demonstrating to


2653
11:33:52,640 --> 11:33:57,360
you that hey it's working as expected okay so just follow along and look at


2654
11:33:57,360 --> 11:34:00,720
this part without having to do it yourself so what we need to do in here


2655
11:34:00,720 --> 11:34:03,760
let's go and import the same localization so i'm just going to say


2656
11:34:03,760 --> 11:34:06,400
import package


2657
11:34:06,400 --> 11:34:11,192
and then we had flutter lock what was it called let's go to main dart


2658
11:34:11,192 --> 11:34:15,192
file and and exactly copy and paste that flutter gen okay and i'm gonna bring it


2659
11:34:15,192 --> 11:34:19,192
into login view dot dart i'm gonna paste it there so we also have


2660
11:34:19,192 --> 11:34:24,000
access to our localizations and the way to grab your localizations is with this


2661
11:34:24,000 --> 11:34:27,912
code so if i write this for instance just in here i'm going to remove


2662
11:34:27,912 --> 11:34:31,760
actually let cons be there i just want you to see why we have to remove const


2663
11:34:31,760 --> 11:34:36,232
in the future so for us to be able to grab this string which is my title in


2664
11:34:36,232 --> 11:34:40,320
our login view we have to say app localizations


2665
11:34:40,320 --> 11:34:44,872
of context and then we can say my title and


2666
11:34:44,872 --> 11:34:50,080
then we have to explicitly on wrapless okay so this is how you grab a


2667
11:34:50,080 --> 11:34:54,960
localization out of your um supported localizations basically the stuff that


2668
11:34:54,960 --> 11:34:58,400
you placed in your arv files okay


2669
11:34:58,400 --> 11:35:02,480
so now we have my title and in here as you can see


2670
11:35:02,480 --> 11:35:06,872
it says hey a value of type null can't be assigned so


2671
11:35:06,872 --> 11:35:11,512
basically this is an issue with having constant here because in in the previous


2672
11:35:11,512 --> 11:35:14,872
i mean up until this point the way we've created our app bar was that we said


2673
11:35:14,872 --> 11:35:19,120
that is a constant string it's a constant text that says login but now


2674
11:35:19,120 --> 11:35:22,480
that all of a sudden we're saying we're retrieving this text from our


2675
11:35:22,480 --> 11:35:26,720
applicalizations these properties unfortunately are not


2676
11:35:26,720 --> 11:35:30,000
defined as constants so if you go in here you can


2677
11:35:30,000 --> 11:35:33,512
see it's just a string getter and that's the reason you can't have cons in here


2678
11:35:33,512 --> 11:35:36,320
so i'm just going to remove that cons it's going to be very happy and the


2679
11:35:36,320 --> 11:35:40,000
reason we have this exclamation mark in here is that the app localization is off


2680
11:35:40,000 --> 11:35:44,640
function and you can see it returns an optional application it is a bit


2681
11:35:44,640 --> 11:35:48,000
unfortunate i don't really like the syntax that everywhere we have to go on


2682
11:35:48,000 --> 11:35:51,120
applications of context and a


2683
11:35:51,120 --> 11:35:55,192
um an exclamation mark in here and we're


2684
11:35:55,192 --> 11:35:59,192
actually going to fix that soon right after this demonstration and because


2685
11:35:59,192 --> 11:36:02,720
this is as you'll see soon it is soon gonna get


2686
11:36:02,720 --> 11:36:06,552
quite annoying to have to always say applicalizations of context exclamation


2687
11:36:06,552 --> 11:36:10,872
mark dot and then the name of your property but so hang on we'll fix that


2688
11:36:10,872 --> 11:36:15,592
soon so now we have the login in here and i'm going to do a hot restart


2689
11:36:15,592 --> 11:36:20,320
and let's see what we get i'm going to bring scrcpy and now you can see i see


2690
11:36:20,320 --> 11:36:25,760
my title goes here swedish all right and that's the title that we put in the


2691
11:36:25,760 --> 11:36:28,480
intel um


2692
11:36:28,480 --> 11:36:33,680
swedish you see right here okay so we have that english one let me bring


2693
11:36:33,680 --> 11:36:37,440
the swedish one next to the english one as well like that


2694
11:36:37,440 --> 11:36:40,000
so we have the english one and the swedish one here and you can see at the


2695
11:36:40,000 --> 11:36:43,192
moment we're seeing the swedish one and the way to actually change the language


2696
11:36:43,192 --> 11:36:47,912
of your um phone on android is a little bit different from ios so here i'm just


2697
11:36:47,912 --> 11:36:52,080
going to go to install nina and that's settings and in


2698
11:36:52,080 --> 11:36:58,232
here i believe it is somewhere it's in system i believe


2699
11:36:58,232 --> 11:37:01,680
and then spirowak which means language and then i'm going to go to language and


2700
11:37:01,680 --> 11:37:07,120
at the moment spirowak here is swedish i'm just going to bring english on top


2701
11:37:07,120 --> 11:37:11,360
and you can see now english is on top so let's go back to our application and see


2702
11:37:11,360 --> 11:37:14,720
if its title is going to change and now all of a sudden you see that it's


2703
11:37:14,720 --> 11:37:20,480
displaying the english title so it's working very very well on android i'm


2704
11:37:20,480 --> 11:37:25,440
gonna get rid of the scr cpy on the screen and bring up


2705
11:37:25,440 --> 11:37:30,640
a an ios device which i've created with um


2706
11:37:30,640 --> 11:37:35,592
so it's an iphone 12 pro that is sitting on my desk right here and i have


2707
11:37:35,592 --> 11:37:41,040
quicktime which is mirroring that iphone screen here so let's go ahead and in


2708
11:37:41,040 --> 11:37:45,512
here stop the process on android and then command shift b on macintosh to


2709
11:37:45,512 --> 11:37:48,480
select the device or control should be on windows and linux and say select


2710
11:37:48,480 --> 11:37:53,272
device and then i'm going to choose that iphone 12 pro and i'm going to go to the


2711
11:37:53,272 --> 11:37:56,800
main dart file because that's how we should run the application because if


2712
11:37:56,800 --> 11:37:59,680
you try to run the application when you're on this file it's just going to


2713
11:37:59,680 --> 11:38:04,400
give you an error telling you hey i don't know how to run an arb file so


2714
11:38:04,400 --> 11:38:08,232
that's the reason you always have to go to a dart file


2715
11:38:08,232 --> 11:38:11,912
in your application so that visual studio code at least knows how to run


2716
11:38:11,912 --> 11:38:14,640
your application so


2717
11:38:14,640 --> 11:38:19,680
now let's bring up um our um


2718
11:38:19,680 --> 11:38:24,960
quicktime here and let's wait basically for this running xcode build process to


2719
11:38:24,960 --> 11:38:27,360
finish and as i've mentioned before sometimes


2720
11:38:27,360 --> 11:38:32,232
xcode can actually be much slower than building with gradle so


2721
11:38:32,232 --> 11:38:37,120
that is quite annoying um so i'm just gonna wait here until this process is


2722
11:38:37,120 --> 11:38:41,272
done let's see how long it takes oh it's installing that so i don't


2723
11:38:41,272 --> 11:38:45,440
actually have to do anything so installing and launching it says at the


2724
11:38:45,440 --> 11:38:48,872
moment so let's get ready


2725
11:38:48,872 --> 11:38:52,320
let's see how long that takes and i can see now that it's going to install the


2726
11:38:52,320 --> 11:38:55,440
application right here we should see some sort of progress


2727
11:38:55,440 --> 11:38:58,832
on my notes


2728
11:39:02,000 --> 11:39:06,080
right there okay now it is launching the application and


2729
11:39:06,080 --> 11:39:12,160
we can see that at the moment the user and face is english and um so i'm gonna


2730
11:39:12,160 --> 11:39:15,832
close this widget and then bring visual studio code here


2731
11:39:15,832 --> 11:39:20,800
as well all right fantastic so um unfortunately mirroring


2732
11:39:20,800 --> 11:39:25,512
an iphone a real iphone on your computer screen with quicktime isn't going to


2733
11:39:25,512 --> 11:39:30,640
allow you to interact with that iphone at all and scr cpy is very special in


2734
11:39:30,640 --> 11:39:34,720
that it connects with adb and at the low level it allows you to interact with the


2735
11:39:34,720 --> 11:39:37,512
screen however the same thing isn't true when


2736
11:39:37,512 --> 11:39:41,192
you're mirroring an iphone screen so right now i have to go and interact with


2737
11:39:41,192 --> 11:39:46,640
this phone by hand so i'm going to grab this phone


2738
11:39:46,872 --> 11:39:52,080
and it is right here i don't know if the cable is long enough for me to show you


2739
11:39:52,080 --> 11:39:58,320
so here is the phone right there and i'm going to then go to system


2740
11:39:58,320 --> 11:40:03,272
settings right here and i'm then going to go to general


2741
11:40:03,272 --> 11:40:07,360
and um and then let's go to language and region


2742
11:40:07,360 --> 11:40:11,832
and in there i'm going to choose swedish right here and


2743
11:40:11,832 --> 11:40:15,192
the the thing that is a bit disappointing in ios is that the


2744
11:40:15,192 --> 11:40:18,872
language that you choose for your system is for the entire system and when you do


2745
11:40:18,872 --> 11:40:24,320
that it's going to kill all the running applications because ios applications


2746
11:40:24,320 --> 11:40:27,680
don't have the possibility to change their language on the fly that's


2747
11:40:27,680 --> 11:40:31,192
something like android does very very well in that


2748
11:40:31,192 --> 11:40:34,720
you can change the language of the entire system and nothing has to restart


2749
11:40:34,720 --> 11:40:38,720
the applications keep running you could even see when we changed the language


2750
11:40:38,720 --> 11:40:43,832
the um like here we couldn't we didn't basically see the application


2751
11:40:43,832 --> 11:40:49,360
terminate or anything so what we need to do now is to ensure that


2752
11:40:49,360 --> 11:40:53,192
we don't change the entire system's language instead i'm going to show you a


2753
11:40:53,192 --> 11:40:58,000
way that you can choose to do in ios that changes only your applications


2754
11:40:58,000 --> 11:41:02,552
language so let's go back in here and let's go and find our application which


2755
11:41:02,552 --> 11:41:07,120
is called my notes i believe somewhere and let's see if you can find it and


2756
11:41:07,120 --> 11:41:10,640
it's right there my notes and now you can see that there's a menu at the


2757
11:41:10,640 --> 11:41:13,680
bottom of the screen that says language and then i'm going to tap on that and


2758
11:41:13,680 --> 11:41:17,360
then i'm going to choose swedish and the reason that you're seeing these two


2759
11:41:17,360 --> 11:41:22,080
options in here because the change we made in our info p list so if i say main


2760
11:41:22,080 --> 11:41:25,440
sorry info p list we can see that we said english and


2761
11:41:25,440 --> 11:41:29,272
swedish in this order and that's why they are displayed here also in that


2762
11:41:29,272 --> 11:41:33,272
order so i'm going to then choose swedish and as soon as i do this you'll


2763
11:41:33,272 --> 11:41:38,080
see up here that our application will terminate because ios can't handle that


2764
11:41:38,080 --> 11:41:41,272
so and there we go the application's


2765
11:41:41,272 --> 11:41:44,640
completely terminated now but that's okay so i'm gonna go back


2766
11:41:44,640 --> 11:41:48,640
here and then open the application on ios oh now we have to debug it as well


2767
11:41:48,640 --> 11:41:51,912
okay because we're in debug mode so let's go ahead and main dark file and


2768
11:41:51,912 --> 11:41:56,232
then run the application again and you can see it says in ios 14 plus


2769
11:41:56,232 --> 11:41:59,832
debug mode flatter apps can only be launched from flutter tooling ids with


2770
11:41:59,832 --> 11:42:04,872
flutter plugins or from xcode so this is a little bit unfortunate as


2771
11:42:04,872 --> 11:42:08,720
well um because then you have to basically run


2772
11:42:08,720 --> 11:42:10,720
your build


2773
11:42:10,720 --> 11:42:14,800
over and over again just while you're testing and this is another


2774
11:42:14,800 --> 11:42:19,272
i would say it's one of the shortcomings of running applications on ios as well


2775
11:42:19,272 --> 11:42:23,192
like there are so many things i feel like android is ahead of ios


2776
11:42:23,192 --> 11:42:27,512
that it's just android is a little bit more developer friendly i would say


2777
11:42:27,512 --> 11:42:31,120
the tooling the whole operating system is a little


2778
11:42:31,120 --> 11:42:35,760
bit more friendly so let's see um i can see now at the bottom of the


2779
11:42:35,760 --> 11:42:40,320
screen it says installing and launching so let's have a look here now our user


2780
11:42:40,320 --> 11:42:47,680
interface should be in swedish if everything goes well of course


2781
11:42:47,680 --> 11:42:50,720
and if things are going well then on ios we


2782
11:42:50,720 --> 11:42:54,552
don't have to do this process over and over again so it's just just to make


2783
11:42:54,552 --> 11:42:58,080
sure that it's working for the first time as you can see now after changing


2784
11:42:58,080 --> 11:43:02,400
our applications into language to swedish now we can see the swedish title


2785
11:43:02,400 --> 11:43:05,760
being displayed on top all right so i'm going to close the widget


2786
11:43:05,760 --> 11:43:09,760
inspector right there and i'm going to stop this process and


2787
11:43:09,760 --> 11:43:14,552
i'm going to get rid of this and now we should be focusing only then on


2788
11:43:14,552 --> 11:43:18,400
deploying on android because it's just so much easier


2789
11:43:18,400 --> 11:43:22,872
so let's go and do a flaster select and then i'm going to say i'm choosing to


2790
11:43:22,872 --> 11:43:28,160
run my application on my android device then i'm gonna put away my iphone


2791
11:43:28,160 --> 11:43:32,080
great so that is that and and the thing that


2792
11:43:32,080 --> 11:43:37,360
we need to talk about now is at the optionality of this app localizations so


2793
11:43:37,360 --> 11:43:40,832
if you go back to our login view you saw that


2794
11:43:40,832 --> 11:43:44,800
applicalizations of context is an optional value because this function


2795
11:43:44,800 --> 11:43:48,960
returns an optional app localizations and there is a way to make this better


2796
11:43:48,960 --> 11:43:53,512
it's one of my favorite ways it's like the shortest extension that we can write


2797
11:43:53,512 --> 11:43:58,080
in our flutter career progress but it's one of the most powerful as


2798
11:43:58,080 --> 11:44:02,000
you'll soon see in order not to have to repeat this code


2799
11:44:02,000 --> 11:44:07,040
what we could do is to create an extension on build context that grabs


2800
11:44:07,040 --> 11:44:12,440
its applicalizations and returns it as a non-optional value so here we have


2801
11:44:12,440 --> 11:44:17,040
applicalizations being returned by passing the context in but what we are


2802
11:44:17,040 --> 11:44:23,040
going to do is to grab the applications from the context itself all right


2803
11:44:23,040 --> 11:44:28,160
so let's have a look at um how we can actually do that in order in


2804
11:44:28,160 --> 11:44:31,760
order to get started let's leave this code as it is right there we don't have


2805
11:44:31,760 --> 11:44:35,360
to do anything special but what we're going to do is to go as you can see at


2806
11:44:35,360 --> 11:44:38,800
the bottom of the screen we have to go and create a new file under lib


2807
11:44:38,800 --> 11:44:42,320
extensions and then we're going to create a new folder as well called build


2808
11:44:42,320 --> 11:44:47,192
context lock dot dart and lock as in localization in this file we're going to


2809
11:44:47,192 --> 11:44:51,832
create our extension on build contacts that allows us to


2810
11:44:51,832 --> 11:44:56,400
return our localizations to the caller all right


2811
11:44:56,400 --> 11:45:00,960
so let's go ahead and do that i'm going to go to lib in here and then


2812
11:45:00,960 --> 11:45:04,872
we have um as the bottom at the bottom of the screen says extensions we already


2813
11:45:04,872 --> 11:45:09,832
have the extensions folder but we only have list folder in there with a filter


2814
11:45:09,832 --> 11:45:14,000
file so in extensions i'm just going to right click and say new file then let's


2815
11:45:14,000 --> 11:45:19,272
go ahead and create build context slash lock dart okay


2816
11:45:19,272 --> 11:45:22,480
and in here what we're going to do is to say


2817
11:45:22,480 --> 11:45:26,640
um import our flutter


2818
11:45:26,640 --> 11:45:30,552
sorry package after gen as we did in the other places


2819
11:45:30,552 --> 11:45:36,080
and then gen l10n applicalization starts okay


2820
11:45:36,080 --> 11:45:42,080
so that's the first import and in here we don't we only need a few symbols or


2821
11:45:42,080 --> 11:45:44,960
actually one symbol which is the applicalizations but we'll talk about


2822
11:45:44,960 --> 11:45:49,192
that soon so let's go ahead and say extension um and we're gonna say


2823
11:45:49,192 --> 11:45:54,400
localization on build context as you'll see it says i have to also import this


2824
11:45:54,400 --> 11:45:57,832
because it is in material so i'm gonna say go ahead and import it


2825
11:45:57,832 --> 11:46:01,680
and i really don't like as if as you follow along with this course i don't


2826
11:46:01,680 --> 11:46:06,400
like to import everything in material like if i only need build context i only


2827
11:46:06,400 --> 11:46:09,760
need build context so i'm not going to import everything so let's just go ahead


2828
11:46:09,760 --> 11:46:14,480
and say show build context and that only brings build context in


2829
11:46:14,480 --> 11:46:16,960
this context


2830
11:46:16,960 --> 11:46:19,592
so what we need to do in here we're going


2831
11:46:19,592 --> 11:46:25,320
to create basically a getter which returns app localizations


2832
11:46:26,832 --> 11:46:30,800
applocalizations we're going to say this is a getter and it's called lock


2833
11:46:30,800 --> 11:46:34,720
and what it does is is returns applicalizations


2834
11:46:34,720 --> 11:46:36,552
of this


2835
11:46:36,552 --> 11:46:41,192
and it puts a an exclamation mark at the end of it so


2836
11:46:41,192 --> 11:46:45,512
and also you'll see that we've imported applications as a whole but we only need


2837
11:46:45,512 --> 11:46:50,400
app localizations from that file so i'm just gonna say show this okay


2838
11:46:50,400 --> 11:46:55,912
so that's that file now it's created and and while this all is going on i'm gonna


2839
11:46:55,912 --> 11:47:01,040
select that and also i'm gonna say run because it is always good to have the


2840
11:47:01,040 --> 11:47:04,872
application running as we're doing hot restarts and hot reload so we can see


2841
11:47:04,872 --> 11:47:08,640
the results on the screen so with this extension now you're soon gonna be able


2842
11:47:08,640 --> 11:47:11,680
to say build context dot


2843
11:47:11,680 --> 11:47:16,960
and then you can get your localizations so let's go back now to this login view


2844
11:47:16,960 --> 11:47:21,272
what we wrote here as you can see is this syntax at the moment but what you


2845
11:47:21,272 --> 11:47:26,000
can replace the syntax with is if we remove this and we just say context


2846
11:47:26,000 --> 11:47:30,720
which is our build context and then you say dot lock and you'll see here it says


2847
11:47:30,720 --> 11:47:34,000
oh i don't know what lock is and that's correct it doesn't know what lock is


2848
11:47:34,000 --> 11:47:36,720
because we haven't imported that extension


2849
11:47:36,720 --> 11:47:39,832
sorry about that i'll just close the switches inspector


2850
11:47:39,832 --> 11:47:43,040
so it doesn't know what that is so i'm just going to say command dot and it's


2851
11:47:43,040 --> 11:47:48,232
going to auto import it for me great and now we can just say my title


2852
11:47:48,232 --> 11:47:52,552
i mean tell me this isn't better this is for me 100 times better like if you


2853
11:47:52,552 --> 11:47:57,512
compare this with what we had before which was this i mean come on


2854
11:47:57,512 --> 11:48:02,800
it's a lot shorter a lot more is the same and i personally think it is it is


2855
11:48:02,800 --> 11:48:07,272
a better code so let me go back all right so let's leave


2856
11:48:07,272 --> 11:48:12,080
this here for now okay just my title let's leave it there and let's go to our


2857
11:48:12,080 --> 11:48:15,592
android application which is scrcpy in here and we can see that it's displaying


2858
11:48:15,592 --> 11:48:19,512
the correct title so if i do a hot restart as well it's still going to work


2859
11:48:19,512 --> 11:48:24,080
and display the string from our um


2860
11:48:24,080 --> 11:48:29,192
from our arb file now that we've done this


2861
11:48:29,192 --> 11:48:34,872
we actually have to talk about all right how are we going to go about


2862
11:48:34,872 --> 11:48:39,512
localizing things well this is the important part you see


2863
11:48:39,512 --> 11:48:44,480
localizing is in a lot of places quite a boring work in that you have to


2864
11:48:44,480 --> 11:48:48,720
literally go for instance if if you're i mean it is boring if you're doing it the


2865
11:48:48,720 --> 11:48:52,232
way we are doing it in this chapter and that you have to go and collect all


2866
11:48:52,232 --> 11:48:55,360
these strings excuse me and then you have to go and


2867
11:48:55,360 --> 11:48:59,120
place them in your arb files and then you have to also place them in the


2868
11:48:59,120 --> 11:49:02,400
swedish arab file and then you have to do the translation


2869
11:49:02,400 --> 11:49:05,360
etc so you have to create keys for all of these so


2870
11:49:05,360 --> 11:49:09,760
this is quite a boring work and it is not something that we're gonna do in


2871
11:49:09,760 --> 11:49:13,440
this chapter because i've already prepared all those for you so you don't


2872
11:49:13,440 --> 11:49:16,640
have to go and write them by your by yourself so


2873
11:49:16,640 --> 11:49:20,872
what i'm going to do here is i'm going to literally go and bring all those


2874
11:49:20,872 --> 11:49:25,120
strings that i've prepared for you and let me see if i can find them


2875
11:49:25,120 --> 11:49:28,480
somewhere in the en rb


2876
11:49:28,480 --> 11:49:32,640
okay i found them right here and what i'm going to do then is i'm


2877
11:49:32,640 --> 11:49:37,192
going to just bring all those strings and place them


2878
11:49:37,192 --> 11:49:42,800
in our intel en arabi file so here you see at the moment


2879
11:49:42,800 --> 11:49:47,360
we have my title and i'm just going to leave my title in there because we're


2880
11:49:47,360 --> 11:49:51,680
using it right now but we're going to have to delete it soon


2881
11:49:51,680 --> 11:49:56,640
and i'm going to paste all these strings that i've prepared for us okay so there


2882
11:49:56,640 --> 11:50:02,000
we go all of those are here now and there is a github repository for this uh


2883
11:50:02,000 --> 11:50:06,080
for this uh course of course and you can go after


2884
11:50:06,080 --> 11:50:08,232
this chapter is done you can go to that


2885
11:50:08,232 --> 11:50:11,512
github repository and retrieve all these strings so you don't have to type them


2886
11:50:11,512 --> 11:50:16,800
by hand either so it is nothing n nothing at all special


2887
11:50:16,800 --> 11:50:20,720
going on about this as you can see we have just a logout button that says log


2888
11:50:20,720 --> 11:50:26,232
out we have versus a cancel button we have the verify email which is something


2889
11:50:26,232 --> 11:50:29,592
that we're using in the verify email screen for instance we have the register


2890
11:50:29,592 --> 11:50:33,512
button we have the restart button let's see where the restart is used


2891
11:50:33,512 --> 11:50:38,000
it is i believe oh restart i believe it is inside the


2892
11:50:38,000 --> 11:50:42,160
verify email screen so if i created for instance um


2893
11:50:42,160 --> 11:50:46,720
if i say pixel to a b gmail foo bar about and i say


2894
11:50:46,720 --> 11:50:51,680
um oh sorry to register screen so let's say pixelity


2895
11:50:51,680 --> 11:50:56,720
gmail.com foo barbaz i'm gonna register this user and then we're gonna go into


2896
11:50:56,720 --> 11:51:00,960
this screen at the moment it says restart and that's this key restart okay


2897
11:51:00,960 --> 11:51:06,080
so i literally gone to through all our screens all our dialogues as well and


2898
11:51:06,080 --> 11:51:09,912
collected all those strings and placed them here in this


2899
11:51:09,912 --> 11:51:14,232
international internationalization enarb file and i've also done the same thing


2900
11:51:14,232 --> 11:51:18,960
for swedish so i'm going to go and bring those files i'm sorry bring those keys


2901
11:51:18,960 --> 11:51:23,440
in here so i've done the translation to swedish and i'm not my mother tongue


2902
11:51:23,440 --> 11:51:28,000
isn't swedish so but i've lived in sweden for a long time so um i can't


2903
11:51:28,000 --> 11:51:32,320
speak swedish a little bit actually enough i can speak enough and


2904
11:51:32,320 --> 11:51:35,680
i'm gonna paste those string in strings in here as you can see they're


2905
11:51:35,680 --> 11:51:39,760
completely in swedish okay so what i've done is literally we have the english


2906
11:51:39,760 --> 11:51:44,160
ones you can see here and we have the swedish ones so it's the same keys but


2907
11:51:44,160 --> 11:51:47,592
different values and again don't worry i understand if


2908
11:51:47,592 --> 11:51:50,640
you're watching this course you're like oh but how am i going to get all these


2909
11:51:50,640 --> 11:51:54,400
just please go to the github repository and you can extract these values you


2910
11:51:54,400 --> 11:51:57,592
don't have to type them by hand and


2911
11:51:57,592 --> 11:52:02,480
you should be good to go so now we have these in order for our


2912
11:52:02,480 --> 11:52:06,640
localizations to be generated in these dark tool files let's go to


2913
11:52:06,640 --> 11:52:09,680
flutter jan and have a look at this gen 10 l


2914
11:52:09,680 --> 11:52:15,120
gen l10n you can see those strings aren't here at the moment because only


2915
11:52:15,120 --> 11:52:20,720
my title should be here somewhere let's see if you can find it


2916
11:52:20,720 --> 11:52:25,360
let's see en locale should reload my title you see


2917
11:52:25,360 --> 11:52:30,320
nothing else is in here but if we do a hot restart all those strings


2918
11:52:30,320 --> 11:52:34,232
should get generated and then we should have them all here you can see login


2919
11:52:34,232 --> 11:52:37,592
verify email all these are provided right here okay


2920
11:52:37,592 --> 11:52:40,720
so that's that part so now we have all our


2921
11:52:40,720 --> 11:52:45,512
strings and we should just be able to do the coding part which is the fun part so


2922
11:52:45,512 --> 11:52:49,680
let's go ahead and take care of that i'm going to close all these files that are


2923
11:52:49,680 --> 11:52:54,232
there at the moment so we have a clean slate to work with


2924
11:52:54,232 --> 11:52:59,272
the first thing that we're going to do is to localize our um what is it called


2925
11:52:59,272 --> 11:53:03,760
cannot share empty note dialogue so let's go ahead in there and then i'm


2926
11:53:03,760 --> 11:53:08,080
going to say command shift p and go to cannot share empty now dialog


2927
11:53:08,080 --> 11:53:12,080
if you remember if you're if the user is trying to share a dial sharing note that


2928
11:53:12,080 --> 11:53:17,680
is its contents is empty so sharing in this case we have a key


2929
11:53:17,680 --> 11:53:21,360
for it so we're just going to say context.lock


2930
11:53:21,360 --> 11:53:24,720
and remember this lock is an extension that we've


2931
11:53:24,720 --> 11:53:28,160
created we don't have access to it unless we import it so i'm just going to


2932
11:53:28,160 --> 11:53:31,120
say command dot in visual studio code and it's going to also import that file


2933
11:53:31,120 --> 11:53:34,080
for me just right here as you can see


2934
11:53:34,080 --> 11:53:37,360
and now we have access to all our strings okay so in here we're just going


2935
11:53:37,360 --> 11:53:41,040
to say sharing which is a key i've created remember all


2936
11:53:41,040 --> 11:53:45,680
these keys are in the arb file and you cannot share an empty note so


2937
11:53:45,680 --> 11:53:51,512
we're going to say context.log cannot share empty node prompt


2938
11:53:51,512 --> 11:53:55,760
which is a key again i've called an okay we also have


2939
11:53:55,760 --> 11:53:58,160
okay right


2940
11:53:58,160 --> 11:54:02,400
okay so and now we've localized our show


2941
11:54:02,400 --> 11:54:07,272
cannot share empty notes dialog fantastic


2942
11:54:07,272 --> 11:54:11,440
so let's go ahead and localize our delete dialogue so i'm


2943
11:54:11,440 --> 11:54:14,960
going to say command shift p visual studio code on mac or control should be


2944
11:54:14,960 --> 11:54:19,912
usually code for windows and linux and this and let's say delete dialog


2945
11:54:19,912 --> 11:54:25,360
in here we have this um little uh title in here so let's just


2946
11:54:25,360 --> 11:54:29,680
say um context dot lock and remember we're in a new file we don't have access


2947
11:54:29,680 --> 11:54:34,000
to log let's auto import it and in here i'm just gonna say delete


2948
11:54:34,000 --> 11:54:38,000
that and prompt we're going to say context


2949
11:54:38,000 --> 11:54:44,400
unlock and delete nodes prompt cancel context dot log cancel


2950
11:54:44,400 --> 11:54:50,232
and here context.lock and was it okay or it's yes so let's just say yes all right


2951
11:54:50,232 --> 11:54:55,120
so that's the localization of this file as well i'm going to say command command


2952
11:54:55,120 --> 11:54:59,832
s or just hot restart the whole thing maybe it's better and i can see a crcy


2953
11:54:59,832 --> 11:55:03,120
crashed unfortunately and that's the problem i've had with this cr cpy for a


2954
11:55:03,120 --> 11:55:06,720
long time that's okay it's an open source software i'm just gonna say


2955
11:55:06,720 --> 11:55:10,160
select device and this and i'm gonna run the


2956
11:55:10,160 --> 11:55:13,272
application so we have it running in the background


2957
11:55:13,272 --> 11:55:17,832
fantastic so uh that's the delete dialog now i


2958
11:55:17,832 --> 11:55:20,232
have to capture at the bottom of the screen in case we have to go and


2959
11:55:20,232 --> 11:55:24,480
localize pretty much everything in our application up to this point and now the


2960
11:55:24,480 --> 11:55:29,512
next step is to localize the error dialog so let's say error dialog


2961
11:55:29,512 --> 11:55:34,160
and in here let's just you can see it says an error occurred and we've called


2962
11:55:34,160 --> 11:55:38,552
a generic error prompt in our arb file if you look here


2963
11:55:38,552 --> 11:55:42,720
generic error progresses and error occurred okay


2964
11:55:42,720 --> 11:55:48,552
so let's go ahead and use that here so i'm just going to say context.lock


2965
11:55:48,552 --> 11:55:52,640
auto import i don't have to explain that anymore and then we say generic error


2966
11:55:52,640 --> 11:55:56,872
prompt we have an ok as well so context lock


2967
11:55:56,872 --> 11:56:01,592
okay so that's done as well


2968
11:56:01,592 --> 11:56:06,480
then we have to go and localize our log out dialog so let's go to log out dialog


2969
11:56:06,480 --> 11:56:10,480
and here log out dialog


2970
11:56:10,480 --> 11:56:14,640
and we're going to do the same thing in here so let's just go ahead and say that


2971
11:56:14,640 --> 11:56:19,040
we're going to use the log out button in here and you see we have log out in a


2972
11:56:19,040 --> 11:56:23,592
few places like if you remember in the main application interface when you're


2973
11:56:23,592 --> 11:56:27,680
logged in with an actual user i'm going to bring in crcpy so you know what i'm


2974
11:56:27,680 --> 11:56:31,832
talking about if you look at this screen if i say


2975
11:56:31,832 --> 11:56:37,592
restart and if i log in with a user and i say van.mp gmail.com


2976
11:56:37,592 --> 11:56:40,552
fubar as


2977
11:56:40,552 --> 11:56:44,160
when you log in with an actual user then you have this little log out in here and


2978
11:56:44,160 --> 11:56:47,832
it says log out and at the same time when you tap on it then there's this


2979
11:56:47,832 --> 11:56:52,160
dialog that says logout so we have a choice in here either you go and define


2980
11:56:52,160 --> 11:56:57,272
two log out strings with different keys in your arb file or you just define one


2981
11:56:57,272 --> 11:57:01,120
and that's exactly what i've done so we're in here i'm just going to say


2982
11:57:01,120 --> 11:57:06,872
context.lock that's how to import and in here we're just going to say log


2983
11:57:06,872 --> 11:57:11,272
out button okay and it says log out button i understand


2984
11:57:11,272 --> 11:57:14,400
it's the title of a dialogue and we're calling the log out button you may just


2985
11:57:14,400 --> 11:57:18,720
go ahead and call this key log out if you want to i'll just call the log that


2986
11:57:18,720 --> 11:57:24,080
logout button remember these are just keys you can change them easily okay


2987
11:57:24,080 --> 11:57:29,592
now that's that's for our title and then for the content we're going to say


2988
11:57:29,592 --> 11:57:34,552
context log log out and dialog prompt and we have a


2989
11:57:34,552 --> 11:57:39,440
cancel button here so let's say let's just say context log cancel


2990
11:57:39,440 --> 11:57:43,592
and again we have another log out button you can see here so log out here log out


2991
11:57:43,592 --> 11:57:48,000
here and then log out in here so there are three places using the same thing or


2992
11:57:48,000 --> 11:57:52,640
same string context log and then we're going to say log out


2993
11:57:52,640 --> 11:57:55,832
button all right


2994
11:57:56,400 --> 11:58:00,400
so that's great so that's that part as well i'm just gonna do command s to hot


2995
11:58:00,400 --> 11:58:02,872
reload


2996
11:58:03,120 --> 11:58:05,760
the next thing that we have to do at the bottom of the screen in the case in the


2997
11:58:05,760 --> 11:58:10,320
caption we have to go and localize our password reset dialogue so i'm going to


2998
11:58:10,320 --> 11:58:15,512
remove log out dialog here and close the tab and let's go to password reset


2999
11:58:15,512 --> 11:58:20,480
email sends dialog and in here we have this password reset


3000
11:58:20,480 --> 11:58:25,272
